PREFACE TO THE FOURTH coluros.-

—n—

Tms volume has not undergone a thorough revision since
hlr. Conington's death, after which a second edition was published
with such additions and corrections as had been inserted by hlr.
Conington himself. The reprint was revised by Mr. Long and

myself. The editors corrected a few errors, and inserted alsoa
few notes which had been sent to ΜΓ, Conington by the Rev. lllr.
Backhouse‚ 01 Felsted School, Essex.

The third edition, published in 1876, was merely a reprint of
the second. For the fourth edition I have dealt with the volume
as with the 1110100111111111,1000011ος1110110110 orthography‚ adding

re·writing the notes where this appeared to be necessary, and
altering the references to Pliny and Catullus as in the other
volumes. All notes added by myself are marked by my initials. ’

in the way of addition and correction. Besides revising the
00100, which has been a matter of considerable labour, I have
added to the volume an essay, formerly published in the J onmal
