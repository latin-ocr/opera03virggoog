ri PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.

composition of the Aeneid. At the end of the commentary on
the second Aeneid Ι have inserted a short excursus on the question
of Virgil’s alleged debt to Pisander.

Ihave careiully read the commentarios of Servius and Tiberius
Donatus and the Verona Scholia,l and added from them and
from other sources a considerable number of new notes to
Conington's commentary. I have occasionally obtained some new
light from glossaries. The abbreviatione Gloas. Laba. and Glosa.
Ampiae. denote respectively the glosses collected by Labbri, and

’ published alter his death by Ducange, aa printed in Valpy's

Stephanus: and the glossaries in the Amplonian library at Erfurt,
edited by Oehler in the Noae Jaararoaer Suppl, Band 13 (1847).
Thilo has conferreda great boon upon scholare by the publication
of the first instalments of his new edition of Servius, which will, I
hope, be speedily completed. Of this work Ι have spoken at
length in the twentieth number of the Journal of Philology.

Ι have consulted Dr. Henry’s Aerreidrol throughout, with the

greatest pleasure and profit.
