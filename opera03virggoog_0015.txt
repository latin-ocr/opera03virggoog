viii PREFAOE ΤΟ THE

little Ι profess to approach the ideal which the nature ol my work
keeps of necessity continually before my mind. Virgil interests
me chiefly because he is a Latin poet: asa studentof poetry, I take

delight in traoing, word by word, his delicate intrioaoies ο1 expres·
sion, which stimulate curiosity while they baffio analysis, as well

, as in endeavouring to appreciata the broader features ο1 his work

as a whole and its place in the history ο1 literature: as a student
of Latin, I am interested in comparing his language with that of
his predecessore and successors‚ and in observing the light which
his use of his native tongue throws on the various unsolved or
hall-solved problema in Latin grammar. Other questions, what-
ever may be their relative importance to the scholar, I have ven-
tured to regard as subordinate: they appear to me to bc loss
immediately connected with the interpretation of Virgil, as they
certainly have less affinity to my own testes and the course ο1 my
studies. Ι have not neglected them: when they have crossed my
path, as they have in almost every page, I have sought to obtain
the requisita information about them: but I have generally been
content to trust the knowledge which has been accumulated by
others without trying to add to it, or indeed affecting to form an
independcnt judgment. ι

Since this work was first undertaken, the criticism ο1 the text
of Virgil hasbeen placed on a new basis by the publicationes
Ribbeck's edition. Previously, though we had reports of the
readings of a great variety of copies, we were unhappily without
accurate collatione of several of the most important ; in the case

' indeed of one of them, the Palatina, we seem to have been with-

out a collation at all. We now possess collatione ο1 all the uncial
MSS„ fragmentary and entire, and of four or five of the most
important of the cursives, which lor minute and painstalring
accuraoy apparently leave but little to desire: and great care has
been taken not only in collecting the testimonias ο1 the different
grammarians who quote passages from Virgil, but in noting the
readings of the various MSS. ο1 each witness. There can be no
doubt that our present critical materiale surpass most ο1 those
