with which we have had to content ourselves till now, not only in ·
degree but in kind, aud that their use is likely to effect a cou-¹
siderable change even in that text of Virgil which, since the time
of Nicholas Heinsius, has been generally accepted as the beat.
That text indeed has now but little to fear from the competition
of the text or texts which it superseded: the authority which
they were supposed to darive from the Palatina has disappeared
for ever now that that copy hasbeen actually examined, and
their real support is apparently to be found in most cases partly
in copies of no name or weight‚ partly perhaps in the arbitrary
conjectures of early editors. But the testimony of the Medicean,
on which Heinsius chiefly tested, has been considerably weakened
by the results of the new collatione: in very many instances the
other uucial MSS. are seen to be arrayed against it, while its
readings may not unfrequently be accouuted for by the paral·
lelism of other passages in Virgil, which the transcriber appa-

rently remembered. Probably however it is premature as yet to
decide on the whole question: we shall learu the real value of
our newly collated MSS. better as we become used to them, and
there may be a danger of accepting novelties of reading simply
as novelties-a danger which I seem to see exemplified iu Rib-
beck’s text, and which my readers will perhaps find to be
exemplified in mine. The general result certainly confirma what

1 ventured to assert in my former Preface‚ both as to the existence
of many varieties of reading which cau hardly be accouuted for
on palaeographical or other external grounds, and which must
often be estimated by the somewhat wavering measurement of
individual preference, and as to the sufficiency of a text made
up from one or other of the MSS. or early authorities without
critical conjecture. Iu the more important of the two instances
in the Eclogues where, following others, Ι had ventured to depart
from the MSS.‚1 have now learnt from Lachmann and Madvig
that no change was necessary: and if there are any places in the
present volume where a word hasbeen introduced from the
dictum of a critic without some ancient authority, it will be
