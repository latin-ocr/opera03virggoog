0 case 01 spelling, such as ‘ Cyclopius’ for‘ Cyclopeus,’ or ‘deri-
pere’ for ‘diripere’ Here I am sorry to say Ribbeck 10 01111 less
to be commended than in the choico 01 MS. readings. In several
places he has introduced emendations into the text, generally
conjectures 01 his own, which are in every case, in my judgment,
worse than needless: noris he in general more happy in his
attempta to point out interpolatione or to indicate lacunae.
Hitherto the text 01 Virgil has enjoyed asingular immunity from
arbitrary criticism. In the last century, while Horace was being
transformed alternately by the splendid audacity 01 Bentley and
the more formal and pedantio dogmatism 01 Ounningham, Virgil
remained nearly in the state in which Heinsius had left him.
Ounningham indeed proceoded from Horace to virgil, whose text
he reformed in obedience to certain canons which he supposed
himself 10 have drawn from 0 scrutiny 01 tho best MSS.; but
his edition, though ourious and interesting, seems 10 have pro-
duced no effect, whether 00 being 0 posthumous publication, or
from the absence 01 1110 dolat which attended 0 controversy with
011 adversary like Bentley, even when that adversary declined 10
reply, or perhaps because the labours of Heinsius rested on 0 basis
too firm to be easily disturbed. Gilbert Wakefield, towards tho
end 01 the century, editod both Horace and Virgil: but his
attempts 01 innovation were too desultory seriously to affect
either. Probably the greatest amount 01 misapplied ingenuity ’
that has been bestowed on virgil, till we come to Peerlkamp in
the present century, is 10 be found in the conjectures of Schrader,
which I know only as reported by Heyne and Ribbeck. They
are always, or almost always ingenious, showing that degree 01
insight which is required to perceive an anomoly 01 expression,
and 11101 degree 01 1001 which hits on 0 word that might possibly
have been used instead ; but there their praise must cesse. Such
ingenuity is,I believe, almost wholly inapplicable to an author
like Virgil, whose text, supported 00 11 10 by an ample variety of
testimony, requires not emendation but illustration. If he 1100
