hitherto escaped the fate of Sophocles, whose peculiarities of
expression, so curiously analogous ιο his, have ιοο often been
changed by critical licence, the guinis his and that of Latin
literature. Whether it would be desirable that our knowledge
of MS. materiale should be still farther extended by an equally
accurate collatiou of the cursives not examined by Ribbeck, I do
not presume to say. There cau be no doubt that au apparatus
criticus like Ribbeck’s is far preferable tuone like Heyne and
Wagner’s: as little doubt can there be that to collate the remain-
ing copies satisfactorily would be an almost eudless task. , In the
Bodleian Library at Oxford¹ alone thare are about twenty MSS. of
Virgil, hardly any of which seem to have been collated (Ι except
of course the Canonician MS. which Mr. Butler has examined so
thoroughly); the College Libraries too contain a few, the read·
ings of one of which, a copy in Balliol Oollege Library, No. 140,
referred by Mr. Ooxe to the fifteeuth century, have been noted
with scrupulous careby my friend ΜΓ. Ε. Palmer, and placed at
my disposal. I myself examined ten or eleven of the Bodleian
MSS. ιο discover the authority for the readings ‘litus harenosum
Libyae ’ in Aeneid 4. 257 (see N ote on 4. 257 at the end of the
Fourth Book) and ‘Trinacriis ' in Aeneid 5. 573 (see Note there),
doubts having arisen about the existence of each ; but almost
the only other passages I turned to were Aeneid 1. 668, where
all agreed with the Medicean in giving ‘iniquae' aud the cele:
brated lines about Helen in the Second Book, which they were
unanimous iu omitting in the text, one of them adding the
passage in the margin. On the whole it would seem that while
it may be advisable ιο apply ιο an inferior MS. in a case like
that which Ι have mentioned, ιο ascertaiu a reading not otherwise ’
certified‚ it would be waste of time to perform partially a work
which, to have any velue, should be performed entirely. It is
oue thing ιο find that a particular reading which seems necessary
to the sense has probably some better support than mere con-
