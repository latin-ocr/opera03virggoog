xii PREFAOE TO THE

jecture: it is another to collect all the readings of a copy with·
out knowing what place it holds among the members of one 01
01110101 1110101101101011111103 01 MSS. through which the text 01
a popular classical author has been transmitted to us, or indeed
before it has been distinctly ascertained what those families are,
and what their history 1103 been. A critic 01 the New Testament
may he landably employed in establishing a theory 01 recensione
induetiwely hythe examination of cursive no less than 11110101
Μ88.; but in the present state 01 0103010οῙ studies we shall
probably have to wait long before any one will think it worth
while 10 qnalify himself for writing 0 detailed history 01 the text
01 Virgil.

In reporting MS. readings I have in general made a selection ’
from Ribbeck's materiale, noting all such 1011011013 as appeared
af any sort af importunae, and rejecting only those which seemed
obvious errors, pointing to nothing but the carelessness 01 the
transcriber. The case is one where it is difficult 10 draw the
line; and I 1001 Ι shall be thought with reason 1011010 done 100
little for scholare, too much for ordinary readers. Iam sorry to
say thatI have not been consistent in speaking of different classes
of readings in the same copy: in the case of the MedieeanI 11010
discriminated what are called the first or second reading 110111
what are called the reading ‘a manu prima’ or ί3001111110;’ in the
case of the other Μ88.Ι have 101 the most part spoken more
generally, talking 01 ‘original’ ar ‘corrected’ readings. Were
the work to be done again I should adopt the general designa·
tion in all cases, as better suited 10 the ordinary reader: as it is
I trust the discrepancy will be pardoned.

The commentarios which I have used have been in general the
301110 as those employed for the Eelogues and Georgica I have
lost the campanienship 01 111. Keightley, and have gained that

compendious, more convenient than Forbiger’s, though not so full,
and with more traces of independent judgment. He has studied
Servius. with care, and quotes him at times very appositely : and
