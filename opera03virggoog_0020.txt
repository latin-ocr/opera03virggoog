' SEOOND AND THIRD EDITIONS. xiii

he has paid considerable attention to his author's peculiarities of

language and metrc, to the latter of which subjects he has devoted
an elaborate appendix. His fault is an occasional tendency to see
insuperable difficulties arrd suspect interpolatione: but it is kept
within bounds, and may perhaps only operate on the student as
awakening a wholesome spirit of iuquiry. Dr. Henry’s work is
rather a collection of copious observations on numerous detoched
passages (‘ N otes of a Twelve Years' Voyage of Disoovery,' as he
somewhat quaintly calls it) than a regular commentory: but I
have found it of the greatest use, as my frequent references to ·
it will show.² The form is, perhaps, a little cumbrous, and the
endeavours after precision not always successful: but there is
freshness arrd originality in every page: alarge number of the
views are at once novel and sound: and the illustratione from
other authors are good and apposite, though we may sometimes
feel that themora obvious sources have been neglected for the
less obvious. Ι have consulted an elaborate commentary on the
first and second books recently published by Weidner (Leipzig,
1869), which I am glad to welcome as a proof that German
scholare are applying, to exegesis that spirit of extensive and
systematic researoh which of late years hasbeen almost confined
to textual criticism.

For the notices I have given from time to time of varieties in
the Trojan legend and the story of Aeneas’ migration unknown to
Virgil, or recognized only in the way of distant allusion, I have
been indebted almost entirely to Heyne’s Excursuses, which seem
to me to presente rare union of learning, sagacity, and sobriety.

‘ lnquiry into the Credibility of Early Roman History.' My intro·
ductione to the several books of the Aeneid are naturally longer
in some cases than those prefixed to the several Eclogues and
books of the Georgica: indeed, the Introduction to the Sixth
Book has grown into a short Essay. In the general Introduction
