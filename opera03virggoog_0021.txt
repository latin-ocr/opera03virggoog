xiv Pnnnncn ΤΟ SEOOND AND THIRD EDITIONS.

Ihava eontroverted Mr. Gladstone's view of the relation ol the
Aeneid ιο the Homerio poema, as expressed in the third volume
of his ‘ Stadios! In my former volume Ι was thought,I believe,
to have disparaged unduly Virgil’s olaim to originality: Ι may
nov be considered to be taking the opposite side, in vindieating
his right to be oritioizad independently of Homer. Both views
are‚I believe, true, and therefore consistent: but it is possible
of eourse so to maintain either as ιο appear unmindlul of the
other. .

My obligations ιο my former eolleague, Mr. Goldwin sarith,
are unfortunately oonfined in the present volume almost wholly
to the notes on the First Book, which we originally eomposed
together in 1853: and even they have sinae been so completely
reoast that it would be difficult now to point to any part of them
as specially due ιο him. I need not say that I have still had the
benefit of Mr. Long’s assistance.

JOHN OONINGTON.
