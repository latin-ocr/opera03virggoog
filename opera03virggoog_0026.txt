INTRODUCTION.

Is turning from the Eclogues and Georgica to the Aeneid, we are no
longer confronted by the opinion which insist-s on Virgil’e claime as a
strictly original poet. The days are past when Scaliger could compare
Virgil and Homer in detail, and pronounce that the scholar had in
almost every instance excelled his master; nor would a modern
reader easily tolerate even those less invidious parallels, such as were
not infrequent in the last century, where Virgil was measured against
Homer on the same principles ou which Johnson has measured Pope
against Dryden, aud with substantially the same results. It is hard .
to read without a smile the apologetic tone in which Pope himsell
vindicates Homer against the admirere of Virgil, pleading that the
old Greek hae at all events the advantage of having written first,
that· if he hed a less cool judgmeut, he holds the heart under a
stronger enchantment, and that to endeavour to exalt Virgil at his
expense is much the same ae if one should think to raise the euper-
structure by underminiug the foundation.1 It is now the turn ol the
critic of the Aeneid to use the language of extenuatiou aud speak with
batcd breath. On theone side it is admitted, as it is asserted on the
other, that in undertaking the Aeneid at the command of a superior²
Virgil was venturiug beyond the province of his genius, and that all
we can expect to find is the incidental success which could not fail to
be obtained even on uncongeuial ground by the poet of the Georgica
I have elsewhere explained the reasons which lead me to qucstiou
thc appropriateness of the special praise usually given to Virgil'e
agricultural poetry‚ aud couceded‚ though with more hesitation, to
his pastoral compositione, as if the true bent of his mind were to be
found in his sympathy with external nature, at the same time that
1 have spoken as strongly as it was in my power to speak of the
marvellous grace and delicacy, the evidence of a culture most elaborate
and most refined, which shine out in the midst of a thousand incon-
gruities of eostume and outward circumstance, and make us forget
