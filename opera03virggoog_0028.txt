on the story which, supported as it is hythe authority of the elder
Pliny: there seems no reason to doubt, that Virgil himself, when
dying, condemned his Aeneid to the flames. Rightly understood,
that story seems tacentem, not a confession that he had mistalren his
powers, but simply ene more instance of the fastidiose and exacting
nature of his aelf-criticism. The explanationis consonant to all that
we know of Virgil’s character, es shown in his writings; and it
ean only be a private opinion which we may ourselves entertain
about the merit of the poem that would lead us to seek ior any
other. Suetonius tells us that Virgil was overtaken by death at the
time when he was intending to spend three years in polishing and
elaborating the Aeneid: and we may imagine for ourselves what
would bathe valueof three years of correction in the judgment of
s poet like virgil, and how abortiva he might consider the worlr which
had lost the advantage of so long a gestation. We cannot, indeed,
tell, except in a very few obvious cases, such as the hemistichs, and
perhaps also certain inconsistencies in the narrative, of which I have
spoken elsewhere,l what may have been the actual shorteomings of
the poem as they appeared to its author. He may have introduced
verace, as the story says he did, which were intended as mere tempo·
rsry makeshifts? prope te stay the building until more solid supporta
should be forthcoming3 but modern criticism has not in general been
very happy in pointing out these wealr places, and fer the present we
must be content to admit that, as regards the execution of the poem,
at any rate, our conceptione of what is required fall infinitely short of
Virgil's own; aud that though we may hope, in some measure, to
appreciata what he has done, we can form no notion of what he left
yet to dn. Such an admission of ignorance is no more than the
tribute which we pay, naturally and cheerfully, to a consummate
artist. ln any case, we need not doubt that the feeling which made
Virgil wish to rob the world of his greatest poem was simply the
mortification of leaving in a state of comparative imperfectiori a work
which he hed intended to bc his masterpiece. To imagine thet he
was sensible of the nnreality which, to a certain extent, characterizes
the Aeneid, as compared with the Homeric poems, is to imagine an
anachronism and an impossibility‚ te attribute to him a thought which
isinconeistent with the whole tenor of his writings‚ and must have
been alien te the entire current of sentiment among his contemporaries,
whether admiring or adverse. He seems never te have tormented
himself with doubts that he had not realized the rustic vigour of
