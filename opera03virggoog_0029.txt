xxii , AENEIS.

Theocritus, or the primitive simplicity oi Hesiod, He appropriatos
their form boldly and openly, and does not ask himself whether he
has reproduced their spirit. To be the Roman Homer3 ιο write the
sequel of the tale of Troy, not as an inferior, but as an equal‚ not as
a younger son oi the victorious raes, bnt as the heir of those many
ages which had liftcd the conquered people ιο a height far above their
conquerors; ιο combine the glories of the heroic age with the august
antiquities of his own nation3 this was an ideal which might well
captivate a mind like Virgil’s‚ and which less partial voices thau those
of an applauding comt might have told him that he was able to
attain⁹

The chasm which separates the Aeneid from the Iliad and Odyssey is
undoubtedly one which is not easily spanned. It is true that sufficient
account has not always been taken of the numerous intervening objecta
which break the distance and afford resting-plaoes to the eye. The
substance of the Homerio poetry, the conductos the action and the
conception of the actore, came to Virgil modified by the intermediate
agency of the Greek drama. His view of the form may have been
similarly affected by the example of those later Greek epics of which
the poem of Apollonius is the only surviving specimen, and by the pre-
cepts of that critical fraternity of which the author of the Argonautica
was no undistingnished member. But the unsurpassed emineuoe of
the two writers, the bard or bards of pre-historic Greek and the poet
of Angustan Rome, will always make them prominent objecta of oom-
parison or contrast3 and the parallel is itself oue which Virgil, far
from avoiding, has dona his utmost to challenge. To a modern reader
the exactness of the parallel only serves to make the contrast deeper
and more unmistakable. Mr. Gladstone says nothing which a critic,
Ἴ not swern, like himself, absolutely to the service of Homer, need hesi-
tate to admit, when he calls attention to the extraordinary amount of
admitted imitation and obvious similarity on the surlaoe ol the Aeneid,

and pronounces nevertheless that the poem stands iu almost every
fundamental particular in the strongest contrast to the Iliad} Both
features, the identity and the diversity‚ are, as I have just said,
sufficiently familiar to us3 we have seen them in Virgil’s treatment
of Theocritus and Hesiod, and we shall not be surprised to meet them
again in his treatment of Homer. On tho identity, indeed, there is
but little for me to say which has not been anticipated in what I have
