IN TRODUOTION. xxiii

admnced in my Introduction to ‚the Eclogues. Tho diversity is a
moro complex question, and may well occupy us somewhat longer.
The productior of the Aeueid was part of that general burst of
litersry enthusiasm which distinguishes the Augustae period. Roman
literature had always been imitativc; Pacuvius and Attius had set
themselves to make the best they could out of Sophocles and Aes·
chylus 3¹ audit was doubtless in his own judgment, as well as in that

oi eulogistic critica, that Ennius appeared to be wise and brave‚ and a
second Homer.⁸ But the period which witnessed the establishmeut ot
the empire generated new hopes and aspiratione among she poete oi
Rome. 'l'he fervour oi an age, hali revolutiouary, hali organis in its
character, had produced intellectual activities which the imperial
system was not slow to weleome and cherish. 'I'he writers ot the new
era asw that Grecos had as yet yielded but few oi her spoils to her
semi-barbarous invaders; and they plauned fresh expeditione, which
should be undertaken under more exalted auspices, and return crowued
with greeneraud more luxuriant laurels. The ebullition of anticipated
triumph which opens the Third Georgic doubtless represents the real-
feeling of the poet, though the vision which he there professes to sec
does not correspond in its details with that which his better genius
afterwards revealcd to him. Graece was to bc conquered‚ and con·
quercd with her own weapons. The gemes were to be the verit-
able Olympio gemes, transplanted to the banks of the Mincio, those
gemes of which the race and the caestus are the type; and the cere·
mouial of the day is to bs varied with the accessoriee of a Roman
triumph. It was in this spirit that he addressed himself to the taek
of reproducing Homer. The imitation of externals was a thing not
to be avoided or dexterously conceeled, but to be openly aud boldly
embraced; and it was the hitherto uuapproached excellence oi the
model which was held to constitute the glory of the success. Even in
his own day there appear to have been critice, probably rival versifiers,
who reproached him with having taken so much from Homer; and
the answer which he is said to have made shows the light in which he
wished his own labours to be regarded.⁴ “Iret them try to steal for
themselves as they say I have stolen for myself, and they will find
that itis easier to rob Hercules of hie club thau to rob Homer ot a

⁸ Hor. 2 Ep. 1. 501011. The ‘somnia Pythagorea¹ are evidence enough of what
he thought ot his relation to Homer.

Vergilii scripsit pauca admodum obiecta ei proponit, saque circs historiam iere

Herculi olavam quam Homero versum subripere! '’—H. N.]
