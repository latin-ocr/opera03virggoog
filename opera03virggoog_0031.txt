single verss.” It was an act of high-handed brigandage‚ which, rightly
appreciated‚ carried with it its own justification. In the long hours
of laboriose days, pariug down aud refining the verses which had been
poured out in the exuberance of the morning,⁶ he had grappled with
the Grecian Hercules, and had again and again wrested from him that
weapon which had so long been the terror of meaner frcebooters.⁸ Ι
have elsewhere romarked on Virgil's absolute silence about Homer,
who, throughout the Aeneid, ie never named or even iudicated; but
no oue would interpret it as the silence of a writer anxious to ignore
or conceal his obligations. Even were spic narrative as favourable to
the introduction of personal notices as pastoral dialogus or diductio

disquisition, it would have been superfluous to mention Homer in a
poem which invites comparisou with the Iliad aud Odyssey in its whole
external form, aud even iu its very title, and contains an imitation or
translation from Homer in almost every page.

This avowed rivalry, I venture to think, should be borne in mind in
estimating‚ not only the similarity of the Homeric and Virgilian epioe,
bnt their discrepancies. When we require that virgil, drawing as he

does his characters from the circle of Homeric legend, should exhibit
them as they arc exhibited iu Homer, we arc not only forgetting, what
Virgil could scarcely have forgotten if hc would, the changes which
those characters uuderwent as they passed under the hands of Attio and
Alexandrian schools of poetry‚ but we are mistaking the whole attitude
assumed by Virgil with reference to his illustrious prodecessor. Homer,
iu his eyes, is not the father alilrs of history aud of poetry‚ the sole
authority for all our knowledge about the Greeks and the Trojano,
their ethnology, their polity‚ their moral relations to each other ; he is
the rival poet oi a rival nation, the party chronicler of a qnarrel which
the Trojsns had bequeathed to their successore, and those successore,
after many centurias, had pushed to a victorious issue. Was it likely
that a Trojan would have accepted the Homeric estimate of his nation
and his nation’s cruel enemies? and was it to be expected that the heir
of the 'ijaus should dwarf his representation oi Trojau worth and
Trojau valour to a Homeric standard Ρ The lions had at last comato
be the painters 3 and though they could not represent their progenitor
as victorious over the man in that great legendary struggle, they could

’Gallina 1210, Suetonius 22. Quintilian, Inet. 10. 8, cites Varius for the
statement that the number of verses compossd by virgil daily was very small.

‘ That this view oi the character oi Virgil’s imitatione was taken by the ancients
themselves is sbown by a passage iu the 'I'hird ‘Suasoris' of the elder Seneca
(quoted by Heyne, Dissertatio de carmine Epioe Vergiliano), who says, speaking
ot a supposed appropriatiou of Virgil’s words by Ovid, “fecisse quod in multis aliis
versibus Vergilius locent, non surripiendi causa sed palam imitandi, hoo animo ut
