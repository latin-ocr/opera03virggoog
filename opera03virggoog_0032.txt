INTRODUOTION. . xxv

porti-ay it as a contest of fraud and cruelty with heroic endurance
and genuine bravery; they could poise the event more doubtfully in
the balance, and call down indignation on the crimes that stained the
bour of triumph3 they could point to the retribution which fell, even
within the period oi tho legend, on the homes of those who had made
others homeless, and shedow forth in prophetie vision the yet more
tenible recompenso which history was to bring in the iulness oi time.
Aeneas is drawn by Homer at a time when, from the nature oi the
mse, he could only play a secondary part in the action3 yet Homer
admits his reputation among his countrymen, and grndgingly concedes
his real prowess, while he makes the 'l'rojan hero's future the special
concern of destiny, provided for even by those gods who are the fiercest
enemies oi Troy. Virgil takes up his story when he is leit alone as
the one surviring protector oi his country, the forlorn hope of those
who sought to reciet, during the sack of the city, the recognized leader
oi the 'lhuy'an migration. Worsted as he had been by Achilles, and
even by Diomed, it was no less true that he had been a terror to the
lords of the Danaans and the armies of Agamemnon3 uor was there
any reason why he and his Trojans should not prove too shong for
the Italian natione, though they had proved too weak for the forces of
Greece. Even in Homer it is easy to see that the characteres Ulysses
has more sides than one: hc is the princeos policy‚ because with him
every species of fraud is lawfu13 and it is natural that his stratagema
should be differently estimated by those in whose favour they are
exercised and those to whom they brought havoc, exile, and death.
Virgil, it is true, represents his Ulysses as engaging in crimes from
which the Homeric Ulysses would probably have shrunk3 hut we must
not judge a poet as we should jndge a historiari who were to invent
actions in order to support a preconceivcd theory of character. If
the right oi independent treatment be conceded‚ it must be allowed to
extend, not only to the interpretation of character, but to the invention
of incident. Regarding Homer as a party chronicler, Virgil was not
bound to assume that he hes recorded all the actione of his hero, any
more than that he has given a true colonr to those actions which he
has recorded. And so the poet of Troy, having taken euch a measure
ss it was in the nature of a Trojan to take of Troy's subtlest enemy,
might fairly avail himself oi any post-Homeric tradition which might
serre the causo that he had to advocate, or even create for himself
new traditione, so long as they were plausible and consistent. “Aut
famam sequere, eut sibi convenientia finge.’' 'Po be plausible and
consistentem a poet’s sole historieal dnties3 and in this instance
plausibility and consistency are to be estimated, not according to the
view which sets up Homer as the one record of historicel truth, but
