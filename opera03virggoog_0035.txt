xxviii AENEIS.

cardinal offence against history and etbuology staring him in the'faoe,
Virgil would have found it in vain to effect oraim at accuracy.
Accordingly, he appeals indifferently to all the associatione ot bis
readers, whether vague or exact. Here he takes advantage of an
obscure tradition; there, of a loose popular identification. He talks
oi Doriaus at a time when the Dorians were scarcely known, and
confers on the Trojans the name of their Phrygian neighbours. He
generalizes from a part to the whole, and then comes down from the
whole to some other part; just as where, in describing the 'l'rojan
horse, he first speaks of it as piae-wood, then as maple, and lastly as
oak3 not, I think, from confusion or forgetfulness, butas an assertion
of the poet’s privilege to represent, in as many ways as he pleased,
the general notion of wood. Iu short, he isan artist, au Italian
antiquary, a Roman oi the Augustan period, speaking to the average
educated intelligence of his own day3 he is anythiug rather than
what modern admirere of Homer would wish him to be, a hierophant
oi “the inner Homeric world,’' an oxpounder of “primitive history,
philosophy, policy, and religion,'’⁹ as contained in Homer.

Such a course of independent rivalry, however, could hardly bc·
pursnedwithout provoking the consequent Nemesis. A story of the
heroic time of Greece, treated in an essentially modern and Roman
spirit, was sure to leave a sense of incongruity on the mind, not only of
a Homeric student, bnt oi a more popular reader. A reader of this
sort might be utterly uuconseious of a thousand inaccuracies of cos-
tume; be might feel the loss oi primitive simplicity of manner to be
compensated by the greater stateliuess of the modern heroic 3 but he

could scarcely fail to be struck with au essential want ot consistency in
the drawing of the prinoipal figures, which, being Homeric, must neces-
sarily be old, and being Virgilian, must as necessarily be new. It is
this, I think, which constitutes the secret of the dissatisfaction which
is generally felt with the character of Aeneas. Το represent him, as
some modern critica have done, aa simply mean and feeble, unmanly
and unheroic, is unjust, and even absurd. His appearances iu Homer
ought not to prejudice our opinion about his appearances in Virgil;
nor perhaps would they, were it notior an error iu judgment com-
mitted by the poet himself, who, in his spirit of dramatic fair dealings
towards his hero's enemies,-a spirit which will call for our notice
again very shortly,—makes them taunt him with his Homeric escapes
and evasious of danger, allowing them, at the same time, to confound
what Homer never would bave coniounded, and identifya warlike
Trojan with an effeminate Phrygian. We are wearied, it must be
confessed, by being continually reminded of his piety; though that
