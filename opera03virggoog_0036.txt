INTRODUCTION. xxix

may be partly owing to our misapprehension of the use of the epithet‚
which wss doubtless intended to be a Homerio one, attached to the
nsrne as a sort of prefix, and to be taken as a matter of course ; bat
his piety is not merely nominal: it shows itself in his whole feeling

end conduct to tbe gods, his father, and bis son. Heyne, who had a
eonl to admire and reverence both Homer and Virgil, remarks on the
dignity and beenty of Aeneas's address to Evander. His faithfulness
to the memory of Pallas is all the more noble, as apparently being not,
like that of Achilles to his dead friend, gronnded on strong personal
affection, bnt rather the offspring of generons seli-reproach for his own
involuntary failnre to discharge a sacred trust. His long forbearance
towards lausus, and the revulsion of feeling when he sees him dead,
contracte strangely with the “genuine manliness ’⁹ with which Turnus
exnlts in the prospect of killing Pallas, and glories over him when
killed. . But the greater the tenderness and grace of these traits of
character, the harsher the jar with which we find the hero of the
Aencid exhibiting at other times the saragr, indomitable spirit of the
hero of the Iliad. 'l'here is tenderness, deep tenderness, mingled with
the ferocity oi Achilles: yet we are not surprised when, after receiv-
ing Priam gracionsly, and lesing his own sorrows in sympathy with
the poor old king, he is roused to momentary fury by a word spoken
ont of seaeon. But the temper of Aeneas is less impulsive, and hie
gentleness more abiding and untroublcd, so that our feclings are
shocked when we sechim plunging his hands in blood ae deeply as a
Homeric warrior, and reserving the sons of two families tc be sacri-
fieed alive on the funeral pile of his friend. It is in keeping with the
manners of the heroic age3 but it is notin keeping with the hnmanity
with which the poet’s modern spirit has led him to invest the rest of
the character. It is this inconsistency between the heroic and the
modern type which we feel in Aeneas’s treatment of Dido. Stripped
of its accessories, the conduct of Aeneas to Dido is not very unlike
that of Ulyssee to Calypso,if not to Circe. He is thrown on her coast;
heis treated hospitably3 he accepts the position of a husband; he
leaves her that he may go to hie natural home. It can hardly be said
that the deity of Calypso constitutas an essential difference between
her and Dido. If she is a goddess, her words show that she feels the
love anderen the jcalonsy of a woman; and the criticisml which
contrasts Ulysses's farewell to her with tho language of Aeneas to
Dido might perhaps have been spared, if it had been recollected that in
Homer she herself receives the order from the gods to pert with
Ulysses, while in Virgil the whole burden is thrown npon Aeneas, who
has not only ic justify himself for going, bnt to vouch for the snper-
