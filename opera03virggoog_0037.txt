natural compulsiou under which he goes. But for a hero to leave a
mortal love was no novelty in the heroic age, as the titles of Ovid’s
Heroic Epistles sufficiently show. 'l'be novelty ie in the interest which
Virgil has excited in the situation aud feeliugs of his forsaken heroine.
He has struck the chord oi modern passion, aud poweriully bas it
responded3 more powerfully, perhaps, than the minstrel himself ex·
peeted. Had Homer written of Dido, we should probably have been
called on to sympathize with her but little; our feeliugs would have
been with the bero whom she strove to keep from the home whither
he was bound. There were reasons which might have iudueed Virgil
to give a similar eolonr to his narrative. All his sympathies are
Romam and the breaeh between Dido and Aeneas is the symbol and
the propheey of the quarrel of Carthage and Rome. It is hard, too,
to suppose that in sketching the Carthaginien queen, who endeavours
to keep Aeneas frorn hie kingdom, he did not think ageiu and again of
the Egyptian enchantress to whom Antouy would have transferred the
sceptra of the western world, whose blandishments hed prevailed over
the great Julius, and had been successfully resisted by Octavianus
alone. Circe might have supplied the legendary framework, Cleopatra
the animating historieal spirit; and even though the Trojan Ulysses
had yielded to the allurements of the charmer, we might have hailed
the flesh oi his drawn swerd, aud sent our hearts along with him in
his jouruey from the euchauted shore. But Virgil has not chosen to
paint a picture like this. Following in the track oi Apollonius, he has
lavished all his art on the presentation of a vivid pertrait of female
passion. Dido’s flame has been kindled, not from within, but from
without, bys supernatura] power; the generosity of her nature has
already shown itself in the princely hospitality which she extends
to Aeneas aud hie shipwreeked comrades; but, aiter all, we sympathiae
with her simply as a woman ; it is the mere exhibition of the deptbs

fication as ho can plead for his flight: but no oue seems to ns se
truitorous ae Aeneas, except it be Jason3 and the reason lies in the
depth ol colouring with which Virgil, like Euripides, has painted th<
agonies of the abandoned queen.

The relation of Virgil to Homer, as l have said already, unquestiou-
ably lurnishes the most important point of view from which the
Aeneid can be regarded by one who wishes to estimato the surroundiug
circumstances which told upon the genius of the Augustan poet. 'Phe
expectation of an unknown birth which should be greater than the
Iliad was doubtless the vision which illuminated the later years ol
