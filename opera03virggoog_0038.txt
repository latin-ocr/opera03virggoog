Wrgil’s own life, as we know it to hare occupied the mind oi his con-
temporaries. But it was not simply by contemplating Homer, by
studying him intently and gradually appropriating his beauties, that
virgil hoped to rival him ; he was to be encountered principally indeed
with his own weapons, bnt partly also with those supplied tc the
hands of a younger competitor by long centurion oi subsequent cnl-
ture. The extent and variety oi these appliauces are only imperiectly
know to us. Virgil probably had access to the whole ol what bad
been written by any author of note from Homer’s time to his own ; in
the remains that have come down to us whole classes of composition
are entirelywanting, aud those which we have exist only iu specimens
more or less numerous. The cyclic poeta and the other spic writers of
Graece properare mere shadowy figures to us, bnt to Virgil they had a
real persoual existence ; they may have modified the torm of his poem;
they must to a certain extent have supplied the data from which hs
constructed his story. It is not till we come to the Athenian drama
that we are able to trace definitely the operation of a really powerfnl
agency upon Virgil’s genius. Even there our losses are neither few
nor unimportaut; we lrnow that a considerable number of the plays
of the three grem tragedians embraced various parts of the tale ot
Troy, yet of these we can only be said to possess the Ajax and the
Philoctetes of Sophocles, the Rhesus, the Troades, and the Hecuba oi
Euripides. Of Sophocles especially we are told, that “ he so greatly ¹
delightod iu the epic cycleae to have horrowed whole dromas from its
contents,'’ and there is ,reason to think that no less than three of his
plays traversed the ground occupied by Virgil in the second Aeneid;
but of the Laocoon we have only a brief outline of the plot, and thirteen
lines, six of them significant ; oi the Ξοανηφόροι, a bare indication
oi the subject, so bare that it is a question whether it really points to
a separate play ; of the Sinon, three unimportant words. Great, how·
ever, as our losses are, we need not doubt that our gains are greater.
That which constitutas the main value of Greek tragedy as a step iu
intellectual progress can be abundantly appreciated from the speci-
mens that have come down to us, and wc are able distinctly to recog·
niae its influeuce upon Virgil. I have in some measure anticipated
what Ι am going tc say, in the observatione which Ι have ventured on
Virgil's treatment of character, as compared with Homer’s; but the
point is one which will well bear to be explained aud enforced further.

ΜΓ. Grote has shown his characteristic insight in remarking² that
“the great innovation of the Athenian dramatists consisted in the
rhetorical, the dialectical‚ and the etliical spirit which they breathed
into their poetry.” ‘¹ Oi all this,” he continues, “the undeveloped
