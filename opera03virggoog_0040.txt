INTRODUOTION. xxxiii

and a modern reader under the spell of some power-ful analyst of
chancter and motive may interpret to himself many of the feelings
of an Athenian spectator at the Great Dionysia. Perhaps it would
hare been impossible for a poet writing after the opening of this new
fonntain of human interest to return to the simpler portraitnre of
the elder epic; at any rate there'can bc little doubt that Virgil is
strongly tinctnred by the dramatic spirit, and that he has sacriticed
to it the general effect of his narrative. I do not say that Virgil’s
conception of characteris so consistent or so vivid as Homer’s;
donbtless it is not: 1 only say that the dramatic feeling, the drawing
’ of character for character’s sake, the delight in doing rhetorical
jmtice to the personages of the story, is more strongly shown in the
Aeneid than in the Homeric poenis. One signal instance of tbisI
lure already noted in the character of Dido; the character of Turnus
affords another not less remarkable.

Ιι has been ingeniously suggested that the reason for the eu-
tbnsiasrn with which Virgil throws himself into the character of
Turnus, is that here at least he feels himself to ιο be “an Italian
minstret, singing to Italians about an Italian hero.”⁸ National feeling
did undoubtedly work in Virgil, but not, I think, national feeling of
this kind. Like the rest of his countrymen, he carad for Italy not
independently of Rome, butas the broad base on which Roman power
was built. His creed as a patriot would be expressed by the words
of Varro, “ Licet omnia Italica pro Romanis habeam.’' The Virgil of
Dante's vision may talk of “that low Italy for which Camilla the
virgin, Euryalus, and Turnus, and Nisus died of wonnds 3 ”⁴ bnt with
the poet himself the object of the struggle is the establishment of
Rome; and those who resisted the Trojan invaders were not Italian
patriota but men deaf to the voices of the gods, and blind to the
course uf destiny. Here again the secret seems to be, that Virgil is
impregnated with modern feeling, and that Turnus occupies ground

which, to modern feelings, appears unassailablc. As in the case of
Dido, the fact that the gods are on the side of Aeneas makes but
little impression on ns3 we hear their dictates and their wernings,
bnt the note does not ring with the same awful eleemess as in the
Homeric poems3 our human feelings are roused, aud our cars
are filled with other sonnds. The words of the oraclo are express,
and we feel that Amata‘s interpretation of themis a mero gloss;

⁸ Gladstone, vol. iii. p. 512. Gossm makes a similar remark on Aeneid 9. 155 ;
bnt it is obvious to reply that we are not¹ expected to take Turnus and his friends
at their own valnation. Oneonmus fact, however, he mentions, that Silius Italicus

naas “ Rutuli ” as one of his poetical synonymae for the Romans.
