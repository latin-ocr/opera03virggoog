INTRODUOTION. xxxv

we pay to the profouud human interest with which Virgil's dramatic
power leads him to invest a person for whom no minstrel of the
heroic age would have claimed a tear. Il Virgil had been the poet
ol the Odyssey‚ it is possible that our recollectione of insolence‚
cruelty, aud lawless sensuality would not have wholly hindered us
from feeling for the slaughter of the suitors.

The influence of the Greek drama is also to be ohserved in the
prominence given throughout the Aeneid to female characters. Mr.
Gladstone⁸ hae remarked with justice, that while Homer's women are
uniformly feminine and retiring, Virgil’s are slightly masculine and
generally of a pronouuced type; they are agitated by violent passione
aud meet with violent ends. This is ascribed by au able critic iu a
veekly journal⁶ to Virgil’s experience of his own age, when, for the
first time in Roman history, women came upon the stege of public
lile: itis, I think, uo less ducto the influcnce oi the actual stage
oi Attica. Whether or no women were admitted as spectatore of
theatrical representatione at Athens, in the stories that were repre·
sented they had tc bear as conspicuous a part es men: tho exigencies
oi dramatic art required it; and perhaps the fact that their parts were
not- only written but acted hymen, teuded still further to give them
an equality which Homer would never have dreamed of, and which
Athenian life did not sanction. They are not only mer-god in the
aggregate of a sympathizing hut subordinate chorus, accompanying
the action as it were with an under-song ; they occupy individually a
large portion of the dmma, sometimes, like Io or Electra, cs suffecere,
sometimes, like Clytaemnestra or Hecuba, as actore rising to masculine
importunos. Virgil may have had actual precedente, in history or
fiction, for the characters of Dido, Anicetis, J uturna, and Camilla: but
even if he had not, his recollectione of Greek art must have been
amply sufficient both to suggest the thought aud to guide the pencil.

Ol Virgil's more palpable aud measurable obligations to tlrc writings
oi the Greek tragedians there is less to be said. As Ι have already
intimated, several of the plays from which he is likely io have bor-
rowed are lost3 aud iu the remainder the question is one rather ol
conjecture and iniereuce than of direct observation. There cau be uo
doubt, however, that the changes which the Homer-ic characters
sust-siued in passing through the hands of the dramatistS, as well as
in the wear and tear oi common tradition, had their full effect on
Virgil’s conception of the personages who make up his gallery of the
heroic age. The appearance oi Helen in the Troades ol lluripides,
