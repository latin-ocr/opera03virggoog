characteristics of a period of renaisssnce. But the connexion between
Virgil and Apollonius is closer than could have been preeumed from
any mere general consideratione. After the Iliad and Odyssey‚ the
Argonautics is the only poem which the intelligent criticism of
antiqnity declares tc have fumiehad an actual model to the author oi
the Aeneid‚ and the similarity is one which the reader cf the two
vorke does not take long to discover. Not only is the passion of

Medea in Apollonius’ Third Book confessedly the connterpart oi the ¹
panion oi Dido in Virgil's Fourth, bnt the instances are far from few
where Virgil hes conveyed an incident from hie Alexandrian pre·
decessor, altering and adapting‚ but not wholly dieguising it. The
departure oi J ason from hie father and mother resemblee the departure
oi Pallae from Evander3 the song of Orpheus is contracted into the
song of Iopas, ae it had already been expanded inte the song of
Sileuns3 the reception of the Argonauta by Hypsipyle is like the

“ reception of the Trojans by Dido, and the parting oi Jason from the
Lemnian princess reappeare‚ though in very different colones, in
the parting of Aeneae from tho queen of Carthage3 the mythical
representatione in Jason’s scari answer to the historical representa·
tione which distinguished the shield ol Aeneas from that of Achilles3
the combat oi Pollux with Amycus ie reproduccd in the combat of
Entellus with Dares; the harpiae of Virgil are the harpiee of Apol-
lonius, while the deliverance oi Phineus hy the Argonauta may have
furnished a hint for the deliverance oi Achemenidee by the ijans,
an act of mercy which has another parallel in the deliverance of the
sons oi Phrixus; Phiuene' predictions are like the predictions of
Helenns; the cave of Acheron in Asia Minor suggests the cave oi
Avernus in Italy3 Evander and Palles appear once more in Lycus and
Dascylns; Here addi-esses Thetis as Juno addreseee Jutnrna3 Triton
gives the same vigorous aid in launching the Argo that he gives to
the stranded vessels cirtensem, or that P01tunns gives to the ship
of Cloanthus in the Sicilian race. Minor resemblancee cf thought
or expression are easily detected by a very cursory perueal of the
Argonautice3 I have myseli noted at least fifty oi them, which will he
iound in their places in my notes on the Aeneid, Altogether it might
naturally be supposed that we possess what every critic would admit
to be sn invalnahle masura, a poem occnpying a middle position
between the Homeric spice and the Aeneid‚ and making the transition
imm the one to the other intelligible.

YetI am greatly mistaken ii the reader of the Argonautics will find
any such expectatione iulfilled in any adequate senec. The similarities
ci detail are there, douhtless more than I have enumerated or dis-
covered: but the poem, taken ae a whole, does not remind us cf the
