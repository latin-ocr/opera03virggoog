INTRODUOTION. xxxix

power of euchantments more mighty than her own. Accordingly,

when she retines to her chamber we have her thoughts and also her
dreams3 the lastnot simply mentioned, like Dido’s on the night after
Aeneas’s story, but recounted. She goes to her sister, who is fortunately
us excited as she, though from a different cause; and even au arrange-
ment which gives her hope of binding J ason to herself does uot prevent
her from passing the dreary midnight hours in an agony of hopeless
longing, which she is at one time nearly ending by swallowiug a drug
from her own easket of poiseus. Yet, though there is power and beauty
here, it is not the power and beauty of Virgil. Even the passage in
which Medea, with the casket lyiug open on her lap, is struck with a
sudden horror of death, and feels as she never felt before, that “the
light is sweet, auditis a pleasant thing to behold the sun,” deep as is
its truth aud pathos, does not affect us as we expect to he affected hy
an incident in an epic poem. Itis too modern for Hemer; Virgil
might have owned the feeling, but he would have been content to
indicate it in two or three lines. The conference of Here and Pallas,
aud their joint visit to Aphrodite, are evidently imitated from Here’s
visit to Aphrodite in the Feurteenth Book of the iliad, and are as
evidently Virgil's model in the scene between Venus and cupid at
the end of the First Aeneid‚ and that between June and Venus at the
beginning oi the Fourth; but they do not impress the reader as ho is
impressed by their Greek originales by their Latin eopy3 they are
graeeful, fanciful, in a word, Ovidian; but they are not epic. The
description of Leve overreaehing Ganymede at dice, the bey-god ercet
aud radiant, his playmate poutiug and pettish, is obviously made fer
pointing3 but the picture would not find a place in a heroic gallery.
Nor is Apollonius writing iu the ‘grand style' when he introduces
Aphrodite playiully pinching her son's cheek, and bribing him to attaek
Medea by a promise 01 the magia ball with which Zeus played when a
bahe in his cavern-nursery of Ida. The interview between J ason aad
Medea iu the temple of Hecate is teuder and touching3 but Virgil
would never have descended te the prettiness of the comparison of
the two lovers, bashiul and silent, to tall pine-trees at first standing
still iu the calm, aud then breaking into a rustle under the agitatiou
of the wind: a smile which Valerius Flaccus has to tone down and .
render less graphia in order to adapt it to tho genius ethis quasi-
Virgilian imitation.⁸ When the voyage recommenceS, the poem again
causes te interest us. 'Phe treacherous murder oi Absyrtus is narrated
