mour as his owu3 in the othercase it is a despot, who walks through
the houses of his subjecte, and takes away anything that strikes his
fancy, ior the adornmeut of his own palace. Almost all that we know
oi the actual obligations of Virgil to the Punic War of Naevius, is
that in Naevius' poem, no less than in Virgil’s, Aeneas is supposed to
be questioned about his departure from Troy, that Naevius speaks of
Dido and her sister Anna, from which it is inferred that the questiouer
oi Aeneas is the Carthaginien queen, and that the consolation addressed
by Aeneae to his orew in the First Aeneid and the discourse between
Venus aud Jupiter in the same book ere, as we are told iu words
which must necessarily be understood with some latitude,⁹ ‘entirely'
takenirom theold poet. It must be confessed that the two or three
lines quoted by Servius in exemplification of the hints which Naevius ⁶
gare to Virgil do not suggest the notion oi any very close imitation.
When Naevius says of the wives of Anchises aud Aeneas-

“ Amborum uxores
Noctu tholad exibant capitibus opertis
Flentes ambae abeuntes lacrimis oum multia,”

we are not obliged to think that but for them Virgil could not have

written-
“ Litora eum patriae lacrimans portusque relinquo
Et campos ubi Troia fuit.'' ¹

And we feel that the Virgilian Aeneas might have represented himself

as ‘wondering at the multitude ’ ⁴ of those who followed his fortunas
‘animis opibusque parati‚' even if Naevius, speaking of the same
gutheriug‚ had not specified the three points of numbers, ‘eorum sectam
sequentur multi mortales,’ bravery‚ ‘multi alii e Troia strenui viri,'
aud wealth‚ ‘ubi iores cum auro illi eribant)⁶ Nor is it likely that the
Saturnian measure, ‘ the barbarous atterance of woodgods aud bards‚’

eulis filii, et Iuppiter eum de futurorum prosperitate solatur. Hic locus totus

hint oi Aeneas's ehield from Naevius, whom he further supposes him to have fol-
lowed in making Romulus the grandson of Aeneas (lectvol. i. ed. 1844, p. 26);
but the first uotion rests on an arbitrary interpretation oi Naevius, the second ou
amisunderstanding oi Virgil.
