which would sufficiently account for Virgil's imitation if the fragment
of the Annals had never been preserved by Macrobiual while it leaves
ns no means of judging how Ennius would have treated such a situa-
tionis he had not had Homer to draw from. The account of Romulus
and Bemrm waiting for the augnry, preserved by Cicero in the first
book of his De Divinatione, is not a very remarkable specimen of
narrative power. Homer would have introduced more details; Virgil
would have treated those which Ennius gives in a morc artificial way,
dwelling on one or two, and hinting the rest3 both would probably
have thrown income short speech, directly or indirectly expressed, to
show the feeling ol the rival brothers and the attendant multitude.
But without venturing farther on the precarious ground of hypothetical
criticism‚ we need scarcely doubt that there was nothing in Ennius'
conception of his art which Virgil was likely to welcome as a help
towards improving upon Homer. hiring in a prehistoric time, Homer
(Ι nse the name for convenience' sake, not as taking a side in the con·
trovercy about his personality) is the only poet who has attained the
grace and fiuish of a literary period3 he is the only primeval poet so
complete in himself that it might be questioned whether it would have
been an advantage to him to have lived later. There may conceivably
be onear two tonches in Ennius which appear to show a more modern
feeling than Homer’a, a keeu sense of colour,⁸ an appreciation of
philosophy⁹and literature as such; for an age, even when relatively
less advanced than some former age, is yet in a certain scuse the heir
of all that have gone before it, aud tha age of Ennius in particular
possessed the rudimenta of criticism and aspired after culturc; but,
regarded in the grass, Homer is mature and articulate, while Ennius
is still crude and infantiae, and it was not to be expected that the
large uttemnce of the divine foretime of Graece should come mended
to Virgil’s ear when repeated by the stammeriug lips of his Italian
ancestors. Virgil may have believed, as Ennius did, that the soul
which dwelt in his own breast had once animated Homer3 but he
probably wonld not have recognized Ennius as the intermediate channel
of its transmission.

lt is needless to say anythiug of the rcst of the earlier Roman epic
writers, who are indeed mere names to us; to speculata on the extent
to which Virgil's impressione of Apolloniua' poem have been modified
