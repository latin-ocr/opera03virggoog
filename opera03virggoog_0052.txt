8110011 has 0 great poet had 0 1000 promising subject to deal with
111011 virgil· when he undertook 10 write the Aeneid. The growth 01
the Roman empire, and with it the spread 01 0 civilization higher, 11
we take it all in all, than any which had been previously known
in the ancient world, was indeed a fect all-important 101 the 1110101101
and tbe statesman‚ and inspiring enough 1ο the imagination 01 a poet.
The problem was how 10 give poetical 101111 and vitality 10 the great
idea 'Phe springs 01 the native Italian literature hed, in the
Augustan age, been long choked up. The Italian poeta had left
Naevius 101 behind thern, and went 10 Homer 101 their metre and
the handling 01 their subject. But instead 01 the fresh and living
creatione 01 the Hellenie fore-time, the Romans found, in the legend
01 Aeneas, only 0 11101000 mythology, the spirit 01 which was true to
nothing but the vanity 01 the Greek historiens who invented it. In
the following remarks an attempt will be made to trace the origin

perhaps Βορέας, and would seem to be 0 patronymic -from Αἶνος 01

Sammo. It may be worth while tc put together some other 110000 01

founder 01 Cyzicus was Αῖνεύς, whose nemeis another patronymic

(13. l), there was a township called Αἴνεια and 0 river Αἴνιον. Coming
further west, we find the Thracian town Αἶνος 01 the mouth 01 the
Hebrus-it is worth while in this connexion to remember Strabo’s
remark that there were many names common 10 'Phraee and the Troad
