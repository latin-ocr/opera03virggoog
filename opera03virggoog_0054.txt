THE STORY OF AENEAS' WANDERINGS. xlvii

patronymic‚ it may also be observed that Ascanius, Asconio, Astaciae,
and Ascanium are names of a city in Aetolia, of a lake near Nicaea, of
uu island among the Sporades, of a district (Ρ) in Bithynia, and of some
islanda off the coast of the Troad. The names, therefore, both of
Aeneas and his son are closely connected with names of places; indeed,
it does not appear that Ascanius is the son of Aeneas in any poet
earlier thau Stesichorus.

Aeneas in the Homeric poema is the sou of Aphrodite, the heaven-
protected, heaven-favoured hero whose raca is to endure and to rule
after that of Pm'am is destroyed. A family of Aeneadae retained, at
Scepsis in the Troad, a memory of their bygone royalty in certain
functione, perhaps priestly, which they were for long allowed to exer-
cise (Strabo, 13, 1). Ide not venture to offer any opinion as to tha
actual relation which these Aeneadae bore to the Aeneas of the Iliad;
or to decide whether or no the Homeric hero is merely a name, in-
vented to account for the existence of the royal and priestly family,
around which the subsequent storias of his wanderings grew up step
by step. But I think that we must in any case start from the names
of the places with which Aeneas was said to have been connected. If
we may trust Dionysius (l. 48), the legende which dealt with the fate
of Aeneas after the capture of Troy were various and irreconcilable.
Menecrates of Xanthus represented him as having betrayed Troy to
the Greeks3 others said that he was sent into Phrygia hy Pm'am on
some military semiue And the stories which represented him as
leaving the city of his fathers did not agree how far hewaudered,
Hegesianax, and Hegesippus the historiari of Pallene, bringing him
only aa faras that peninsula, while others'made him leave Thrace and
go on usfar as Arcadia, where he founded a city which was named
Caphyae after the Trojan Capys. Remembering the Thracian city
Aenus, and the Pallenian Aeneia, we need find no difficulty, considering
the contradictory and untrustworthy characteres these stories, in
attributing the idea of Aeneas' presence iu those places, which is
apparently aa old as Lesches, solely to their names; nor need the con-
nexion ef the Arcadian Caphyee with the Trojan Capys give us any
more trouble than the reference of the Italian name Capua to the
same hero. It may be added that according to Pausanias (8. 12. 8)
there was also in Arcadia a mountain called Anchisia with a grave of
Anchises.

Before going into the question of Aeueas' voyage to Italy, it will be
aa well te consider the remaining traces of the legende which brought
him into various parts of Hellas. Dionysius (1. 50) assuras us that
there were many signs of the presence of Aeneasin Delos, whither
Aeneas came while the island was governed by King Anius. Delos
