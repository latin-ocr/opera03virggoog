THE STORY OF AENEAS’ WANllERINGS. xlix

uected Italy with the wandering heroes who were secking homes after
the destruction of Troy. Thus Diemed and Ulysses were brought
to the shores of the western sess, and those legende grew up to which
laudor in his ‘⁶ Hellenics ” has succeeded so well in giving a poetical
ferm aad interest. The storias of the Trojans Aeneas and Antenor
coming to these regions may doubtless bc readily connected with the
cycle of Hellenic myths. It seems now to be doubted⁹ whether any
distinct allusion to Aeneas’ Italian voyage can bc elicited from the
supposed quotation from Stesichorus in the Iliun table, which
mentions Aeneas as starting for Hesperia. According to Pliny (3. 57)
Theophrastus was the first Greek‘who wrote with any care cn Roman
affairs. Before Theophrastus the notiori had ariseu that Rome had
been founded hy Aeneas in the company of Ulysses. Dionysius
(l. 72) quotes as his authority for this statement the list of priestesses
in Argos. The compiler of these lists is assumed⁸ hy Miiller in his
Fragments of the Greek historiens to have been Hellanicus. In a
story little varying from the former Aristotle asserted that Rome
was founded by certain Ἀχαιοί, who on their return from Troy were
caught in a storm as they were roundiug Cape Malea, aud were at
length carried by the violence of the wind to the coast of Latium.
Here they spent the winter, intending tc sail with the spring. But
some captive women whom they had brought from Troy, anxious to
escape the slavery which awaited them in Graece, took the opportunity
one night of burning the ships aud making further progress irn-
possible. The name Ῥώμη was that of the Trojan woman by whose
advice this measure was taken. This is the story adopted by Hera-
clides bembus, the historiari of the time of Antiochus Epiphanes:
(Fest. p. 268 Miiller, end Solinus l, 2) Heraclidi placet, Troia capla
quosdam exactent inea loco ubi nuere licina est devenisse per Tiberim,
deinde ειιαᾶειιίο Rom nobilissima captiuorum quae lie comes erut,
incenato naribus posuisse sedes, instructura eccesie, et oppidum oh ro
Βοηιεπ vowrisse. He mentions another version: Apolliocles scribit
Romen nce captiuam feisse ul scyra dicium eet, ced Asconio colom
Aeaeae neptem appellationis istius causam fuisse. In the same spirit
the historian Xenagoras made Ulysses aud Circe the parents of Romae,
Antias, end Ardeae, aud Callias, who wrote tlrc history of Agathocles,
made Romulus and Remus the sons of Latinus and a Trajan woman
named Rome. The story of the women burning the ships was after·
wards transferred to the Trojan ficet, which according to one version
