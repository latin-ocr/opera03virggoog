THE STORY OF AENEAS' WANDERINGS. li

the other a Trojan origin. Thus the eomedian Menander, followed

by Turpilius, said of the temple of Venus in Leucis that it was ’
founded by Phaon of Lesbos 3 whereas Varro attributed it to Aeneas
(Servius on Aen. 3. 279). So it was with Baiae, which Postumius,

the author of a work de carente Aeneae, and Lutatius, in his manual

of Communes baleriae, said was founded by Boia the nurse of
Euximns, a companion ef Aeneas. An older account, according to
Varro, said that the name was not Boias bnt Baiae, and the founder

ef the city was Baius, a comrade of Ulysses who was buried there
(Servius on Aen. 9. 710).

Aeneas was once represented aa the founder of Rome, his companions
were shown hythe historiens and poete who succeeded Fabius Pictor·
te have been equally active in other places. Prochyta, according to
Naevius, toolr its name from a kinewoman of Aeneas (Servius on Aen.
9. 715). Capua, according to Caelius Antipater, was founded by a
Trojan Capys (Servius en AenlO. 145). A Trojan origin was assigned
to Cerithus (Serv. on Aen. 7. 209) and to Patavium. In the same
way Caieta, as we hereseon, was said to be the place were the Trojan
ships were hamt.

Thus under the pressure of a great national conflict the Romans
called in a spurious mythology to dignify their cause. 'l'owards the
end of the first Punic war wc have another· instance of thc same
tendency. The Acarnanians, in appealing to Rome for assistance
against the Aetolians, based their claim on the fact that they were
the only Greeks who had sent no contingent to the aid of their
countrymen in the Trajan war (Justin. 28. l). ln the same spirit
the Romans deprived the Corinthians of Leucas and Anactorium,
and made their towns over to Acarnania (Dionysius 1. 51). Soon
afterwards cemes the Roman alliance with Attalus king of Pergamus,
aud the transferente of the Great Mother of Pessinus, the guardian
deity of Aeneas, to Rome (205 aa). The peace medo with Philip
iu the same year included the inhabitants of Ilium on the side of the
Remans; it may be noticcd that Livy (29. 1214) mentions Attalus
and the Ilienses side by side. Nino years afterwards Flamininus,
after proclaiming the frecdom of Graece at the Isthmian gemes,

dedicated at Delphi some silver shields and a golden crown with tho
inscriptions

Αἰνεάδας Τίτος ὔμμιν ὑπέρτατον ὤπασα δῶρον, and
ὃν πόρεν Αἰνεαδᾶν ταγὸς μέγας.
lt is worth while also in this connexion to read the account given iu

hiry (37. 37) of thc interview between P. Scipio Africanus and the
inhabitant-s ef Ilium during the war with Antiochus in 190 aa,
followed by the ceesion to themoi Rhoeteum aud Gergis in 188 ac.
