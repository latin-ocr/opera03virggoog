THE STORY OF AENEAS' WANDERINGS. liii

Dionysius seems on this point to have followed the same authorities
ns Virgil, tor tho notion that the Trojans are ot Hellenic raoe is
followed out by Virgil with tolerable consistency in his selection of
proper names. His Trojano have mostly Greek names: Actor,
Amusicus, Amycus, Anchemolus, Anthene, Aphidnas, Asbutes, Capys,
Castor, Obaon, Chloreus, Uirronis, Olenius, Clytius, Corynaeus, Oretberu,

Diores, Dymas, Ericetes, Erymna, Gyges, and the like. The Italian
names, on the other hand, are ranged on the side ol Turnus: Almo,
Amata, Anxur, Aquicolrrs, Auectius, Astur, Atinas, Aventinus, (taedians,
Garum, Camilla, Cethegus, mamm, Cupencus, noua, Ebusus, Fartus,
Halesus, Herbesus, Hisbo, Lausru, Iziyer, Mauryas, Intcctr'us, Magus,
Messapus, Metabus, Metiscus, Mezentius, Murranus, Numa, Numanus,
Numitor, Quercens, Rapo, Remulus, Remus, Sacrator, Salius, Sarranus,
Sacro, Sulnro, Tiburtus, Tullo, Ufens, Umbro, Valerus, Venulus, Virbius,
Volcens, Votusus.

The story of Aeneas’ alliance with the Arcadian Evander points, l
need hardly add, iu the same direction. I do not know whether a
trnoe of the samo idea is to be found in theory supported by Cato,
Acilius, end many other Roman historiens, that tho Aborigines, with
whom the Trojans eventually united, were Greeks who had corne to
Italy long before the Trojan war (Dionysius l. ll). But it may,I
think, be pcrccived in the account of the part played by Diomed iu the
later story of Aeneas. Cassius Hemina, the historiari of the end of
the second century nc, represented Diomed as giving the Palladium
to Aeneas when the latter was passing through Calabria. According
to Varro, Diomed also gave Aeneas the bones ot his father Anchises.
And virgil, in the eleventh Aeneid, represents the attempta ol the
latins to enlist Diomed in their cause against Aeneas as failing
altogther. ·

Iret us now ior a few momente consider the elementa of Italian
mythology and religione observauce which blended with the Greek
fable just mentioued. The familiar names Lauinium, Laurentum,
Atta, Penates, Iudiyes, Diuturna, Amata, Camilia, ara genuine Italian
worda, and as such point back to a condition oi politica and religion
long prior to the introduction of the Hellenic legend. Schwegler has
rightly pointed out that the Italian centro of the story is lavinium or
lauro-Lavinium, not Rome. Lavinium, il not the politica] at least
the religione capital of the Alban league, continued down to a very
late time to preserve living traces of its ancient importunos. At
lavirdum were the Penates of the Latius and their worship; at
Invinium the consuls, praetore, and dictatore offered sacnfice when
catering upon or laying down their public functione. Macrobius 3. 4.
