THE STORY OF AENEAS' WANDERINGS. lv

aplace in the territoryof Laurentum called Troia where Aeneas
was supposed to have lauded: so Festus testifies, and other authorities.
Servius on Aen. 9. 9, hano (lactarem Laurens ait dici Varro, oppidum
tacet. Sed abi menam Aeneas egressae sit, eam locam Troiam anaca-
pora' traditm. A praedium Troianam iu the neighbourhood of Antium
is mentioned by Cicero (Att. 9. 13. 6) ; Festus mentions a campas
Tromentas, whence the 'tribas Trooaeata'aa. Trosalas was the old name
of a knight, and Troia (not ladas Troiae) that of the well-known
cavalry tournament. Whatever the ultimate origin and the meaning
of tha base from which all these words are derived, and on this point
l offer no opinion, thera seems little doubt that Troia and its cognates
ara genuine Italian words. And if so, especially as there were
remeius of a large ancient encampment near Lauro-Lavinium (Serv.
on Aen. 7. 32), what fact could be more welcome to a Greek dealer·
in cheap mythology than the appearance of the name Troia on
Italian gronnd; what fact easicr to combine with the rest of the
Italian legend? Livy 1. 1. 23 says that Traia was also the name of
the place where Antenor lauded among the Veneti. Was the name
there, as in Latium, the startingpoint aud support of the legend?
Another Italian feature, upon which all the recent scholare,
Klausen, Schwegler, and Prelle1·‚ have already commented, is the
story of the eating of the tablee; this, in the aetolia attributed to
Servius, is rightly referred to the monae puniceae of Roman worship.
The latin Penates was easily identified with the θεοὶ μεγάλοι ol
Samothrace, associated, as we have seen, with the worship of Ἀφροδίτη
Auens. There was a temple of Venus at Antium (Plin. 3. 57) and
at Lavinium (Strabo 5. 3). The latter was probably the Venae
Fratis to whom according to Cassius Hemina (ap. Solin. 2. 14)
Aeneas dedicated the image which he had brought from Sicily. Ι
see uo reason for identifying the word Fratis with the Greek
’Δφροδίτη; why should it not be agauniae ltaliau name? Finally,
Annam himself was made one with the Iuppiter indiges of the country.
It is worth observing that iu its main outline the story of the ⁴
fortunas oi Aeneas after landing iu Italy somewhat resembles that oi
the founding of Troy by Teucer as given by Servius on Aen. 3. 108.
Servius mentions two versione of the legend3 one that Scamander,
driven by a lamina from Crete,mig1atedto Phrygia, and after cou-
qnering the neighbouring Bebrycians in battle disappeared in the
river Xanthus: vator in Xantho sternata-e lapsas aare conparuit. So the
legend of Aeneas as presented by Caesius Hemina and Tibullus 2. 5.

Indigetem: comparo Juvenal 11. 60, alter aquis, alter flaventis ad
nidera manto, and servius on Aen. 4. 619. Scamander’s kingdom, it
