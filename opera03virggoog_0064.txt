THE STORY OF AENEAS' WANDERINGS. lvii

from Livius Andronicus in not exhibiting Aeneas as a traitor tc his
country. The story of Aeneas was probably treated in great detail
and perfect faith by Varro, from whom Servius has several quotations
of mora or less importauce which Ι have endeavoured to collect.
Varro represented the Penates, whom he identified with the Di Magni,
as wooden or marble figures brought by Aeneas to Italy (Serv. on Aen.-
3. la). Originally they were carried by Dardanus from Samothrace
to Phrygia, and afterwards from Phrygia by Aeneas tc Italy. The
story of the Palladium (Serv. Aen. 2. 166) was treated by Varro in
much detail. According to the version which he adopted, the sacred
image remained in the hands of Diomed, by whom it was offered to
Aeneas while the latter was passing through Calabria. Diomed also
gave to Aeneas the bones of his father Anchises (Serv. Aen. 4. 427).
Aeneas in his wanderings was guided bya star, Lucifer or the Stella
Veneris, which moved in front of him until he arrived at the territory
of Laurentum (Serv. Aen. 1. 382). In Dodona he received the oracle
prophesying the famine and the eating of the tables. In Leucas he·
founded the temple to Venus attributed by Menander to Phaon the
lesbian. Varro when in Epirus took note of the names oi the places
where Aeneas had set his foot; his list of names was the same as
Virgil’s (Serv. Aen. 3. 349). He gave further details about the pro-
geuy of the eow, whose body, as we have seen, was shown him
preserved in brine at Lavinium (Serv. Aen. 3. 392). Anna, the
sister of Dido, perished in the flames of her own funeral pyre for love
of Aeneas (Serv. Aen. 4. 682, 5. 4). The name of Castrum Laurens
(Serv. Aen. 9. 8) kept up the memory of Aeneas' camp near Lau·
rentum.

Thus it is clear that Varro must have brought Aeneas to Carthage.
What was his authority for this addition to the current story, an
addition of which there is no mention in Livy or Dionysius, and
which conflicted in the most glaring manner with the commonly
received chronology,⁶ is not clear. It is generally assumed that
Naevius is responsible for the notion of a maeting between Aeneas
and Did0; but the assumption is based upon a line and a half of
Naevius, bhrnde atque docte percantat, ¹qao pacto Troiam arban reli-
querit, in which the subject of percantat is taken to be Dido. Itis “
unfortunate that we cannot traee rnore closely the genesis of the story.
Did it rest on a confusion between the Carthaginien Anna end Anna
Perenna, the Italian goddess of the year? Some such inference is
suggested by the identification of the two in Ovid's Fasti.

‘Servius ou Aen. t. 459, nam quod de Didone et Aenea dicitur falsum est.
musar euim Aeneam cccxi.. annos ante aedificationem Romae venisse in Italiam,
eum Karthago nou nisi η. annis ante aedificationem Romae constructa sit.
According to Timaeus, Rome and Carthago were founded on the same day.
