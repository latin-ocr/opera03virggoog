11111 ΤΗΕ STORY OF AENEAS' WANDERINGS.

1101 00 now 101011]0101010011100000001011001011 or invented by
Virgil, and compare it with the tradition followed by Livy arrd
Dionysius

The stages 01 Aerreas’ warrdcrings as giren by Dionysius are aa
10110001-11001 Troy ho goes 10 Pallene, where he leaves some 01 1110
01011 0011 wealrly followc1s3 thence 10 Delos, therrco 1ο Cythera, thence
to Zacynthus, where, owing to old ties 01 blood, he is kindly received.
Here Aeneas institutes a gymnastic contest for the youth, which 10
01111 kept up. Therrcc he posses ou to Leucas, Actium, Ambracia;
from Ambracia Anchises goes 10 Buthrotum and Aeneas to Dodona,
where hc meets Helenus and the Trojans with him; next 10 1101],
where a contingent was leit to 101111 0 00111010001 001110 Iapygian
promontory. Meanwhile Aeneas eails to Sicily, where he founds
Elymus and Segesta, aud leaves part 01 1110 own following, and thence
10 1101], where hc 100110 successivcly at Palinurus, et Leucosia, at
Misenum, at 001010, and 01 Laurentum. y
· Livy's account 10, compared with this, 0 01010 abridgment. He
makes only two stages between Troy and Italy, namely Macedonia
arrd Sicily. Virgil must apparently have 11101111 upon the same
sources as Dionysius, though he varies the details, 0011 (10 the case
01 Car-thage) 0101100 00 addition 01 which the historiens know nothing.
Thrace, Delos, Leucas, Buthrotum, Sicily, appear both in the narrative
01 1)1011]0100 and in the third Aeneid; Virgil adds Crete and the
Strophades. The story 01 1110 burniug 01 1110 ships by the Trojerr
women, which wc have seen to bc as old 00 1111010110, 10 1000110011 by
Vir-gil in Sicily. Dionysius mentions gamcs instituted by Aeneas at
Zocyrrthns3 01 these Virgil knows nothing. but devotcs 0 whole book
to gemes celebrated 10 Sicily 111 honour 01 Anchises, who according to
his account 11011 died at Drepanum.

Virgil rightly scized upon the fact that Sicily was 1110 000110 01 1110

Virgil’s poetical purpose, Sicily was the meet-ing-poirrt 01 110010 and
Carthago. ’1110 great idea which inspires the first part 01 the 11000111,

, tho idea with which the poem opens, is that 01 bringing Rome and
Carthago into 0 mythical connexion. The authority whom Virgil
immediately followed in 1110 1001101 I suspect to have been Varro,
who, as we bave aeon, represented Anna the sister 01 Dido 00 perishing
in 1110 flames 101 love 01 Aeneas. Tlrat Virgil drew largely upon 1110
, stores 01 antiquarian inforruation collected by Varro may be lakanae

and other features 01 the legend, as Aeneas' presence 10 Leucas arrd
bis following the prodigy 01 the white 0011, were, as ne have secu,

omphalae by Varro in great detail.
