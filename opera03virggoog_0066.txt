THE STORY OF AENEAS’ WANDERINGS. lix

So familiar are we with the story of the Aeneid that we are apt to
terget what violence it does to the tradition generally 1111110111 in
Virgil’s time. That tradition 10 represented hythe third Aeneid;
there Aeneas is brought aa far as Sicily, after a course of wandering
correspondiug fairly with that described by Livy and Dionysiae. But
111 order to bring in the new clement of 1110 story, Aeneas must 110
carried 10 Carthege from Sicily before he can be allowed to go on to
Latium. 'l'he fifth book, ss it now stands, implica a second visit
10 Sicily after the tragedy of Carthago. It is difficolt to suppose that
so awkward a combination 00 this can have entered into the original
plan of 1110 Aeneid. As things now stand it might occur to the reader
that the fifth Aeneid would naturally have followed the third, as the
sixth might naturally have followed the fourth. Virgil had not,
probably, at the time of his death, harmonized the Sicilian aud
Carthaginien episodes iu a manner satisfactory to himself.

'rho way in which Virgil, for 1110 purposes of his epic, has altered
the story 01 Dido, is as striking and characteristic ss anything in the
whole range of his poetry.² In tha universally accepted tradition
Dido's tragic eud was 1111010 her resolution not to become the wife 01
1111110ος and what 111 Virgil is represented as coming upon her es 0
curse for the breach 01 hervow is, 111 the genuine story, the honourable
result of her constancy. No doubt Virgil felt that Varro’s version 01
the story, according 10 which not Dide, but her sister, was sacrificed
ior lore 01Αο11000, would have been tamo and pointless in his epic
poem; he therefore ventured ou a holder flight, aud carried the day.
No part of the Aeneid, if we may trust Ovid, was more eagarly read
than the fourth book; and all readers-were forced to acknowledge the
skill with which 110 made their tears flow 111 0 fictitious 0111100.

In comparing Virgil's account of the early fortunas of Dido with
that of Pompeius Trogus (Justiu 18. 4-6) the reader is struck with
soma minute coincidences 01 language which may show that both
writers drew upon 1110101110 source, but that Virgil for the sake of
brevit-y mutilated the narrative. Toka the two accounts of Dido's
llight from 'Pyr-e. Sychaeus, it will he remembered, is in Trogus’
narrative called Acerbas.

Justin 18. 4. 8, que (foma) 1110011000 Pygmalion oblitas 111110 leemosi

Di'do then is Pygmalion's daughter, aud great-nisce of her husband.
