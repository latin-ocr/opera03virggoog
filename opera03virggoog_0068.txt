ΤΗΕ STORY OF AENEAS' WANDERINGS. lxi

deniq, σκηψαμένη τελετὴν πρὸς ἀνάλυσιν ὅρκων ἐπιτελέσειν, πυρὰν
periatur ἐγγὺς τοῦ οἴκου κατασκευάσασα καὶ ἅψασα, ἀπὸ τοῦ δώματος αὑτὴν
εἷς τὴν πυράν ἔρριψεν. Τιιο vow oi constaney, the pyre and the swerd,
the excuse for raising the pyre, are adopted by Virgil. It may again
be obsersed that rimasse account is the shorter, and also that it differs
hom that oi 'Progne as to the manner oi Elissa’s death.

As for the fortunas oi Aeneas aiter his landing in Latium, there
were two ιιιιιίιι traditione, one of which represented Aeneas as
obtaining the hand of Lavinia only aiter war with her father Latinus,
the other that there was no fighting with Latinus at all, but that war
arose after his death in consequence ot the claims oi Turnus to the
hand of lavinia.

The first, which is the basis oi the version adopted and modified by
Virgil, is alluded to by Servius on Aen. 4. 620, who quotes Cato as
his authority. A quarrel breaks out between Aeneas and Latinus
in consequence of plundering on· the part oi Aeneas‘ companions; in
the battle which ensnes Latinus is slain. So Servius on Aen. 9. 745,
si acritatem historiae requiris, prime proelio interemptus est Latinus.
See aleo Serv. Aen. 1. 259. Livy l. l gives a slightly different
account: alii proelio victum Latinum paeern eum Aenea, deinde adfini·
tatem incense tradunt. The other tradition is given by Livy in the
following terme: alii (tradunt) curn instructae acies constitissent, pri-
usquam sique canerent, processisse Latinum inter primores, ducemque ad·
serrarum evocasse ad conloquium: percontatum deinde qui mortales essent,
ande aut quo casu prefecti domo, quidve quaerentes in aqrum Laurentem
crissen, postquam audierit multitudinem Troianos esse, ducem Aeneam,

dendaeque urb-i locum quaerere, nobilitatem adrrriraturn qentis uirique, et

semisse. There is a general resemblance between this description and
Virgil's words in the seventh Aencid (229) : Dis sedem cuiquam patriis
litusque roqamus Innocuum, et cunctis viridemque auremque patentem.
. . . Fato per Aeaeae iuro dextramque potentem, Siue fide, seu quis bello
est erpertus et annis. It may be that Virgil, though varying the tradition
ior hie own purposes, is working upon the same materiale as Livy.

The account given by Dionysius represents Latinus as at war with
the Rutuli when Aeneas landed. Latinus is forbidden by eracles to
fight with the strangu, and advised rather to ally himself with the
Ἕλληνες. Aeneas advances his claims, and receives from Latinus an
maranae which recalls Dido’s Non ignare mali miseris succurrere

disco. The Trojan hero marries Lavinia; the Aborigines and Rutuli
receive the name of Latini, but afterwards the Rutuli, under the
