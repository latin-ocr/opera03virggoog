THE AENEID ¹AND THE EPIC OYOLE. lxv .

Aeneas in Aen. 6. 525. Ii Welcker is right (Ep. Cycl. ‘2 p. 235) in

nying that the works of Arctinns appear to have hcen the most
considerable among the pocms oi the T1ojan cycle, afterthe Iliad and
odyaeey, virgil may be supposed to have followed him from poetical
reference.
p From the story of the capture oi T1oy, ancl the Ἰλιὰς μικρά oi
lscscbes, virgil does not seem to have horrowed much. Indead, in
details, as far as our evidence goes, he seems to have followed au
altogether different tradition hom that which Lesches adopted.
Iaceches represented the murder of Priam aa oecurring¹ not attha
altar of Ζεὺς ἕρκειος, but at tho door of his palace; he made Acucas’
wife not Creusa, but Eurydice, aud he gave Aeneas himself aa a
captive to Neoptolemus (Weloker 1. c. p. 538). Pausanias (10. ‘25
loll.) describes some pictuces oi the night-battle in Troy, painted at
Delphi by Polygnotus, who, he thinks, followed the account given
by lesches. The details of thesepictures cannot be brought into
harmouy with Virgil's account oi the night-battle in the second
Aeneid, uor do tho names of the combatants, aa a rulo, occur in thom.
The love of Coroebus fou· Cassandra, is however mentioned (10. 27. 1).

Wbcther, when wn'tiug the sixth Auneid Virgil was 'at all in-
tlueuced by the account of Hadea and its terrore, which, according to*

Pausanias (10. 28. 4), was contained in thc Μινυάς and the Νόστοι,
cannot bc ascertained.—[H. N.]
