'l'n subJect nithe Aeneid‚ as propounded in the opening lines, is the settlemeut of
Aeneas iu Italy, aster years of wandering‚ end a short but shnrp final struggle. Itis
boweser only of the events preceding the settlement that the poet really treats—of
the wanderings aad the war. In that, aa in other things, he follows Homer, who
does not show us Ulysses ‘⁴ an idle king, matched withan aged wife, meting lawe ιο

ι nvage race‚” but leaves him fresh from the slaughter of the enitere, from the first
embraoe of his wife and father, aad from the conquest of his disatfected subjecta.
Aeonslingly, the poem divides itself into two parts, the wanderings being embraced
hythe hattho Italian wer by the second. But the two parts naturally involve
different modes of treatment, eomprehending as they do perinde of time widely
differiug iu length, the one seven years, the other apparently a few days. Here
again the example of Homer is followed. The long period nt wanderings is taken nt
spoiutnotfar from ita oouclusicn; enough is told in detail to serve aa a specimen
ef the whole, and the rest is related more summarily by the help of au obvious expe·
dieat, the hero being mado tn narrate his paat adventures to the person whose rela-
tion ιο him is all the time forming one adventure more. This peculiarity of the
Homeric story is noticed by Horace in ewelllruown passage of hie Art of Poetry·
(rr. 146 foll), and recommended ιο ιιο adoption of Epic writers generally; buthe
doen not clearly indicate the reason of it, which doubtlees is the wish to avoid thet
fatal dryness which seems ιο ιο inseparable from all narratives where the events of
many years are told eonttnuously in a short compass. [See vol. 1. p. xxxv. foll.

The First Book of the Aeneid may be said ιο perform well the objecta which it
was no doubt intended ιο accomplish,-th0se cf interesting us in the hero and iutro·
ducing the story. After a brief statement of the subject, we have a view of the
supernatural machinery by which it is ιο ιο worked out; and this, though imitated
irem Homer, where the solitary rancour of Poseidon against Ulysses answnre to the
solitary ranceur of J uno against Aeneas, is elrilfully contrived so es ιο thrnvv a light
en the subsequeut history of the Roman descendants of Aeneas, by the mention,
eren at that early time, of their great enemy, Carthage. It is probable‚as1have
said in the general Introduction ιο ιιο Aeneid‚ that the merit of this thought ’
may be due ιο Naevius, who seems ιο have been the first ιο commit the felicitous
anachroeism of bringing Aeneas and Dido together; but it must be allowed tn be iu

' strici accordance with the spirit of Virgil’s poem, whioh ie throughout that of

was ιο have been his last, the main differenoe being thet the Grecian hero ia
salitsry, having lang since lost all his campaninus, while the trojan is still accom-
