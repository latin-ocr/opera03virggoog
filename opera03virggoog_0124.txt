“ 50 P. VERGILI MARONIS

Ture calent arae sertisque recentibus halant.
Corripuere viam interea, qna semita monstrat.
Iamque ascendebant collem, qui plurimus urbi
Imminet adversasque aspectat desuper arces. 400
Miratur molem Aeneas, magalia quondam,
Miratur portas strepitumque et strata viarum.
Instant ardentes Tyrii, pars ducere muros
Molirique arcem et manibus subvolvere saxa,
Pars optare locum tecto et concludere sulco; 100
