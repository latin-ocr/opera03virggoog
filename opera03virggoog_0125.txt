AENEID. LIB. Ι.

Iura magistratusque legumt sanctumque senatum 3
Hic portus alii effodiunt: hio alta theatri
Fundamenta locant alii, immanisque columnas
Rupibus excidunt, scaenis decora alta futuris.
Qualis apes aestate nova per florea rara

Exercet sub sole labor, cum gentis adultos
Educrmt letus, aut cum liquentia mella

Stipant et dulci distendunt nectare cellas,

Aut onera accipiunt venientum aut agmine iacto
Ignavum bicospecusapracsepibus arcent: 4³5
Fervet opus, redolentque thymo fragrantia mella.
Ο fortunati, quornm iam moenia surgunt!
