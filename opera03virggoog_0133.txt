AENEID. LIB. Ι.

Partibus aequabat iustis, aut sorte trahebat:

Cum subito Aeneas concursu accedere magno

Anthea Sergestumque videt fortemque Cloanthum, 510

Dispulerat penitusque alias avexerat orae.

Obstipuit simul ipse simul perculsus Achates
Laetitiaquc metuque; avidi coniungere dextras
Ardebant3 sedres animos incognita turbat. 515
Dissimulant, et nube cava speculantur amiati,

Quae fortuna viris, classem quo litore linquant,

Quid veniant; cunctis nam lecti navibus ibant,
