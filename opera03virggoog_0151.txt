AENEID. LIB. I.

Ut, eum te gremio accipiet laetissima Dido aaa
Regalis inter mensas laticemque Lyaeum,
Cum debit amplexus atque oscula drilcia figet,
Occultum inspires ignem fallasque veneno.

Exuit, et gressu gaudens incedit Iuli. 690
At Venus Ascanio placidam per membra quietem
Inrigat‚ et lotum gremio dea tollit in altos
Idaliae lucos, ubi mollis amaracus illum
Floribus et dulci adspirans complectitur umbra.
