'rur voice ol eritieism hus unanimously flxed on this book, along with ths Fomth
und suth, rs offording the best evidenoe ol the true grsetness oi virgil. whether
er no ws believe the story told in Suetonius' biogrsphy‚ thet the poet himself chose
these three books to read ιο Augustus ss e specimen oi his work, it indiostes ut eny
rste the jndgment possed by untiquity; end modern opinion hes not been slow te
retity the verdiet

'l'hs eonoeption ol the present bools is eminently fortunate· Homer hes mede
Ulysses tell the story of his wenderings ιο Alcinous, end so hed supplied the sensns
on which the younger ertist might work: but the tnle of Troy tehen forms no pert ot
the narrative ol the Odysssy: it is bristly sung by s bord, whose streins move the
teurs ol Ulyssesus the Trojnn portroits ut Carthago hed mered those oi Aeneas: but
thot is ull Ιι wss open to Virgil ιο melre his hero tell the whole story oi the ds-
struotion oi 'l'roy without trespussiug on Homer's ground ; end he seized the oppor-
tunity. 'l'hs subject oonld not soil to be most impressius, ond it is introduced wilh
perfect propriety. Dido, it is trus, knew the mein incidente oi the siege; but thot
wne ell the more resmn why she should wish ιο hear them from the ehief living
witnen on the side of Troy. Virgil too hos shown his wisdom not only in whet he
hes mid, bnt iu whet he hes left unuin„ Dido’s curiosity would naturally extend
orer the whole ten yesrs; bnt the poet knew tlret s detail oi the siege, naturales it
might be, would wsery his rseders. He tells us thet tlrs queen selred of Prinm und
Hector, ot Diomedonti Achilles; but he does not require us to listen to Aeneas till
he eun concentrnts our attention on ‘the lest ugony oi Troy,’ the one night in which
the city wes tehen und seelred.

The taking oi Troy wes, es might be sxpeoted, s tsvourite subject with poets
before Virgil. It formed pert oi the spic oycle; it wss treated by the mentem ol the
Greek drsme Oi these worlrs the only one thot hes ooms down to us is the 'l'roodes
oi Euripiden und even thot lies its scens leid ulter the catastrophe. whioh it dsels
with only by wey ol retrospeot. We lrnow enough oi the others to bs essursd thet
the mein insidente in Virgil's narrative-the story oi tlre ‘l'rojen horse, the introduc.-
tion ol Sinon, the tregie death ol Laocoon-ers telren from his predeoessors lt
would heve been nnneturul il it hed not been eo. Custom bound Virgil to follow
the legend in its moin bearings es he hed reeeived it, though it leit him quite free,
ss 1 leuve contended in the geuernl Introduotion ιο the Aeuom, to vury minor details,
end gire his own solour to the whole. How sar Virgil is original iu the minutim
ethis treetment, we esnuot tell. lllnorobius indeed mulces ono ol his interlocutors
(Set 5. 2) spetk ol it ns e ieet known to every sohoolboy, thot the story ol this boolr
is tehen elmost word lor word lrom one Pisender, who wrote e mythological history
ot the world in verm bnt though the ehsrge is emeumstentielly mede, it is dis·
