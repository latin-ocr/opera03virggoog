credited by the silence of other authorities, whose ignoranoe contracte strangely with
this schoelboy knowledge: and Heyne‚ in his first Excursns ιο this book, has made
it more than probable that the plagiarism of the poet is really the blunder of the
critic, who is supposed to have oonfouuded tvvo Pisanders, one who lived before
virgil, but did not write the mythologice-historical poem, aad another who did write
the poena but lived after Virgil.1 The little that we know from Servius aad othem
about the treatment of the storias of Laocoon aad Sinon by earlier writers points
rather to difference from Virgil’s version than ιο identity with it: end though we
must not bnild so much on this, aa it is the wont of such witnesses to dwell rather
on points of dissimilarity than on points of agreement, we may take it as showing
that Virgil did really exercise his privilege of varying the smaller circumstances of
the narnative, especially as his svvocessors, Quinctus Smyrnaeus and Tryphiodorue,
who are supposed ιο have been diligent copyists of the early writers, differ from him
considerably in their manner of treatment. At any rate, whatever may have been
Virgil's obligations ιο his predecessore for tha incidents‘of his narrative, we cannot
doubt that the golden thread which runs through the whole, the feeling of Aeneas
himself, is substantially his own. The steps by which the horo eomes to realize his
position as an inhabitant ofa captured city, a partisan of a cause against which the
gods have finally declarem-steps indicated with such subtlety that it is only of late
that they have been fully recognized (see on vv. 322, 402),-are not likely ιο have
been narvsmittcd by legend, while they bear in themselves the strongest marks oi
the poet’s peculiar art

Perhaps thore is no better way of estimating the greatness of virgil in this book
than by glaucing at the manner in which the subject has been treated by the three
later poete, Smyrnaeus, Tryphiodorus, and Tzetaes. ll'ith his example before thena
not to mention the other writers whom they probably followed, they have yet oon·
trived to diveat a most stirring aad pathetie story of a large part cf its interest
Smyrnaeus manas two of his lonrteen books, the twelfth and the tlrirteenth, on the
capture of Troy. He goes over much the same ground as Virgil; bathis narrative
is ssat and lifeless: the incidente do not flow out of each other, end sometimes,
instead of incident, we are put .⁰ff with the tedicus generality of a mere historieal
abridgment. Calchas advises the Greeks to try strategem rather than force: ulysses
on the moment strikes out the notion of the wooden horse with all its details: Neo·
ptolemus end Philoctetes, like hlilton's llfoloeh‚ are for open war, and attempt to
lead their people to battle at oneo, but are checked by a thunderbolt from Zeus,
which quite overawes them; an incident brietly despatched, and apparently intro·
ducod for no object whatever. Soon aiter we hear that the gods are at war with
each athanasia the twentieth Iliad, lvurling as nrissiles tho hills of lda; bat we
are expressly told that while all naturaie convulsed, the human combatants are
unconscious of what is going oa. and even thie invisible versare is soon terminated
by another thunderbolt from Zeus, so that, es before, wo are at a loss to understand
the relevanoy of the incident. When the horse is made, Sinon is left with it, having
expressed to the Greeks his willingness ιο undergo burning alive, or any tortere
that the Trojans may inflict. Accordingly, he stands silent while the enemy ser·
rounds him, trying him first with mild words of maulay, afterwards with the harsher
methods of mutilation and hurning: aad then, having given this undoubted proof of
his contage, he voluntarily tells his story. Laocoon, who disbelieves him, is struck
blindan the spot, the stato oi his eyes being described with a sie-kening minateness
of detail: yet even in this condition he continues arging his countrymen ιο burn the
