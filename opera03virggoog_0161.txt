111 as 11011 as 111 Trojans, and the modes 01 their deaths are enumerated with
1111111011 particularity. Some, we 110 1011, were hit by goblets, others by tables,
0111111 1] 10101101 and spits with meat adhering to them, others by batohets: some

partly, as in virgil, tc the protection 01 his mother, who worded 01 111 weapons 01

Trypbiodorns 11 1 writer 01 1 scmewhat lower stnmp, perhaps equal 10 power 10
Smyrnaeus, but interioria teste and judgmcnt. He concentretes himself chiefly on
110 11001011 110111 and the events immediately connected with it, fifty lines being
given 10 1 0110011 description 01 all its parts, from which it appears 1111 11 was a

and its 111111 01 silver. Ulysses, as ln Smyrnaeus, lays down the programma 01
operatione: the heroes 1110 001 aiter another, as at the cbolleuge 01 Hector in the
seveuth 1001101 11111111,10(1101001111 10 110 1011101ς and when they arc lodged
in the horse, Pallas provides 111001 with ambrosia: immediately 11101 which they
110 11111] compared 10 beasts running down a rook 10 escape a winter torrent, and
waiting in their den, lamished with hunger. Sinonis lest, mangled, like Ulysses in
Helen's story in the fourth Odyssey, with stripes 11010 his own hand, aud tells a
similar story 10 that in virgil, except that he represents himself 01 having been
sconrged by bis comrades because he reluscd 101] with them. The droggiug 01 the
horse into the city is detailed 11 1011001 length-the agency 01 110 gods, which duly
appears 11111 10 the poem, being 1111011111] anticipated, and Η110 being made to
open the gates wider than usual, while Poseidon knochs down 1111101 the stonework
01 the entrance. Cassandra protcsts, as 10 Smyrnaeus, and is severely upbraidcd by
her iether, 11110 sends 1111 10 111 01110101. Helon's story iu Homer is again put
under 1110111100, and the adulteross is mode tc addrese the Greeks within the horse
in the tones 01 their respective wives: but the incident is an isolated 000, and no
attempt is made 10 1111000110 11 with tho rest 01 110 story. For the 111101 the book
