'l'his hc may have borrowed from Dares Phrygius, whose work, as we ucw have it,
abounds in notices of the sort But he is probably original when he says that ha
cannot tell what was tho precise occasion cn which Ulysses fell temporarily into the
hands of the Trojans, his attention ιο ιιο incident having been distractcd hythe
cruel treatment he received from “the crafty wife of lsaao,” cr when he censuras
Tryphiodorus for talking of the horse aa crowued with flowers when it was the
depth of winter, eud professes that he, l'uetaes, had been taught by Orpheus never
ιο tell afalsehood But ιι is an instilt to Virgil even to mention such absurdities
iu connection with the &cond Book of the Aeneid.

meant ιο stand: much ol the Empercr's censure however falls really, not ou virgil,
but on the legend which, as we have seca, he necessarily followed.
