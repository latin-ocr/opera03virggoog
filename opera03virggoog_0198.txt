Ρ. VERGILI MARONIS

Fundit ecus, victorque Sinon incendia miscet

Insultans. Portis alii bipatentibus adsunt, 8³0
Milia quot magnis umquam venere Mycenis3

Obsedere alii telis angusta viarum

Oppositi3 stat ferri acies mucrone corusco

Stricta, parata neci ; vix primi proelia temptant
Portarum vigiles, et caeco Marte resistunt set
Talibus Othryadae dictis et numine divom

In flammas et in arma feror, quo tristis Erinys,

Quo fremitus vocat et sublatus ad aethera clamor.
Addunt se socios Ripeus et maximus armis
