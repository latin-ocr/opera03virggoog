136 P. VERGILI HABONIS

Haerent perietibus scalae, postisque sub ipsos

N ituatur gradibus, clipeosque ad tela sinistris

Protecti obiciunt, prensant fastigia dextris.

Extrema iam in morte perant defendere telis ;

Auratesque trahes, veterum decora elta parentum,
Devolvunt ; alii strictis mucronibus imas
