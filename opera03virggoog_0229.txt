AENEID. LIB. ΙΙ. 155

Ipse Pater Danais animos viresque secundas
Sufficit, ipsa deos in Dardana suscitat arma.
Eripe, nate, fugam, finemque inpone labori.
Nusquam abero, et tutum patrio te limine sistam. 000
Dixerat, 01 spissis noctis se condidit umbris.
Apparent dirae 100100 inimicaque Troiae
Numina magna deum.
Tum vero omne mihi visum considere in ignis
Ilium et ex imo verti Neptunia Troia; 000
Ac veluti summis antiquam in montibus ornum
Cum ferro accisam crebrisque bipennibus instant
Emere agricolae certatim ; illa usque minatur
