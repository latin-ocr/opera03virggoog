174 P. VERGILI MARONIS AENEID. LIB. Π.

ἡρωικά demetam. speaking oi this work, Zosimus (5. 29) says, Πείσανδρος, ὅ τῇ
τῶν ἡρωικῶν &cynardo ἐπιγραφῇ πᾶσαν ὥς εἰπεῖν ἱστορίαν περιλαβών. It appears to
me that the poem mentioned by Macrobius cannot be either oi these. Not the
Ἡράκλεια of the older Pisander, which can hardly have included the capture oi
Troy by Agamemnon and Ulysses. Not the ποικίλη ἱστορία oi the younger, for 1
cannot bring myseli to believe that Macrobius could have been guilty oi so gross a
mistalre as to accuse Virgil ot copying from a writer who lived in the age oi
Alexander Severus. Macrobius speaks oi Pisandes in the same breath with
Theocritus, Hesiod and Aratus: in what he says oi Virgil’s relation to these poeta
he (or hie authority) is, from his own point oi view, right enough; shy should he
be mistalren about Pisander? Nor again, in spite oi the words of Zosimus, do Ι
think that a work such as Macrobius attributes to Pisander could well have borne
the title ἡρωικά θεογάμιαο 1t seems rather to have bccn a continnous chronicle,
anch aa may well have issued from the study oi sorne earlier or later Alexandrian
mit is true that no ancient writer but Macrobius mentium thie Pisander. But too
much stress should not be laid on this consideration. In Gellius, Servius, and
Macrobius we have only a fragment ot the literary criticism oi ancient Italy. '1¹0
telre another instance, we may remcmber that Virgil's debt to Parthenius seems to
have been not inconsiderable (see Gellius 9. 9. 3, 13. 27. 1), yet Parthenius ie never
mentioned by Servius

1 suppose then that there really was a poem bearing the name or Pisander to
which Virgil was in some way indcbted ior some parts at least oi his story in the
second Aeneid. Whether, however, thore was reallya third Pisander who wrote
the poem, or whether ¹it was aa Welcker thinks, ialeely attributed to the older
author, there seems to be little chance of deciding.

Bernhardy, it should be added, agrees with Meyne on this question. -IL M]
