these we have no recorrd: but Virgil 1011 thet 1110 second narrator must be brieter
than the first, and accordingly contracted his story into a single book. Toacertain
extent it wae almost necessary that thore should be a coincidence in the details 01
the two accounts as well as in 1110 original plan. The mythical geography 01 Homer
had become 001101 111000100010010001000, though. like 1110 mythical history, it was
moditied freely, 1101 followed servilely: and as Aeneas was wandering in thesemo
parts 00 Ulysees, and et 1110 aamc time, it would have been unnatural to make their
experiences altogether independeut and dissimilar. Yet the only place in which the
two lines 01 adventure actually touch is when they enter the country 01 1110 Cyclops:
and there Virgil has skiliullycontrived not to rival Homer’s story, but to appropriate
it, and to make Aeneas reap the bencfit 01 Ulyssee’ experience without being
obliged torepeat it in his own person. For his other incidente he is indobted partly
