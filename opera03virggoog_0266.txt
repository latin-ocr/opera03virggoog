192 P. VERGILI MARONIS

Plena per insertas fundebat luna fenestras ;

Tum sie adfari et curas his demere dietis:

Quod tibi delato Ortygiam dicturus Apollo est,

Hie canit, et tua nos en ultro ad limina mittit. 150
N os 10, Dardania incensa, tuaque arma secuti,

N os tumidum sub te permensi classibus aequor,

Idem venturos tollemus in astra nepotes,

Imperiumque urbi dabimus. Tu moenia magnis
Magna para, longumque fugae ne linque laborem. 100
Mutandae sedes. Non haec tibi litora suasit

Delius aut Cretae iussit considere Apollo.
