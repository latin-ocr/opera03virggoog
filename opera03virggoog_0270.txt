196 Ρ. VERGILI MARONIS

Aequora3 dispersi iactamur gurgite rast03
Involvere diem nimbi, et nox umida caelum
Abstulit3 ingeminant abruptis nubibus ignes.
Excutimur cursu, et caecis erramus in undis. 200
Ipse diem noctemque negat discernere caelo,
Nec meminisse viae medie Palinurus in unda
Tris adeo incertos caeca caligine soles
Erramus pelago, totidem sine sidere noctes
Quarto terra die primum se attollere tandem 105
Visa, aperire procul montis, ac volvere fumum.
Vela cadunt, remis insurgimus3 haut more, nautae
Adnixi torquent spumas et caerula verrunt.

Servatum ex undis Strophadum me litora primum
