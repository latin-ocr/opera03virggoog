P. VERGILI MARONIS

Anunrnos
LIBER QUARTUS.

Or the fourth Book oi the Aeneid little remsins to be added ιο what hes been
suesdy said ln the general Introduction. Its snbjeot has made it the most attractiva,
perhaps the most eelebrated, part oi the poem: it hes provolred muoh oontroversy‚
snd thet oi e kind whieh bas an interest, not only ior the sobolar, but ior the general
maden mnoh oi it has been supposed to bo horrowed irem a particular Greek writer,
whose work happens to be preserved: it is the most dramatio portion oi the Aeneid,
and ss such may be viewed in relation to the mesterpieoes oi Greek &amatio art
These are all points whioh appear to belong ιο the sphere of Virgilian oritieism in
general, whether aesthetie or antiquarian; and it seemed natural to disouss them in
that eonnexion. For the questions then oi Aeneas’ treatment oi Dido, oi Virgil's
obligations to Apollonius Rhodius, andei his relations, general and speeisl, ιο the
Greek drame, 1 must refer my readers to what 1 heve said already.

Naevius, ss has been remarlred in the general Introduction, is supposed to heve
preceded Virgil in the enoohronism oi bringing Aeneas and Dido together* As this

parting tragieal or otherwise. All thet we know eonneoting Naevius with the story
of this bools is thet he mentioned Anna, Dido's sister, who appears now in Virgil ior
the first tirno. How this personage earne to be oomplioated with the legendsry history

which has heoome a stoolr one at oertein periodo oi the history oi the drsma, espe-

would seem simply to heve taken the traditionsl story ot Dido, end moditisd it us
