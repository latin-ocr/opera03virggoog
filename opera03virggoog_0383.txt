AENEID. LIB. 1v.

Quid tum? sola fuga nautas comitabor ovantis?

Rursus agam pelago, et ventis dare vela iubebo?

Quin morere, ut merita es, ferroque averte dolorem.

'fn lacrimis evicta meis, tu prima furentem

His, germana, malis oneras atque obicis hosti.

Non licuit thalami expertem sine erimine vitam· ιιι
Degere, more ferae, talis nec tangere curasl
