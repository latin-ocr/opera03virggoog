310 P. VERGILI MARONIS

Tantos ille suo rumpebat pectore questus.
Aeneas celsa in puppi, iam certus eundi,
Carpebat somnos, rebus iam rite paratis.
Huic se forma dei voltu redeuntis codem
Obtulit in somnis, rursusque ita visa monere est,
Omnia Mercurio similis, vocemque coloremque
Et crinis flavos et membra decora iuventa:
Nate dea, potes hoc sub casu ducere somnos, 000
N ec, quae te circum stent deinde pericula, cernis,
Demens, nec Zephyros audis spirare secundos?
Illa dolos dirumque nefas in pectora versat,
Carta mori, variosque irarum concitat aestus.
Non iugis hinc praeceps, dum praecipitare potestas? ott
