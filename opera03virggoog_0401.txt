' Tha burning 91 the ships by 1119 Trajan women was a part 91 the Trajan legend,
though the story was very variously told, as will he seen by any one who will consult
Hsyne's Excursus on the subject, some placing the soene in Graece, some iu Italy,
1111119 9119 account connected itwith tha foundation 91 Rome? Dionysius agrees with
b'irgil in making it an incident iu 1119 yoyage 91 Aeneas. In 1119 account 91 the 1919
91 Palinurus, with which the book closes, the poet, as usual, has combined an Italian ·
tradition withan imitation 91 Homer. Thepromontory 91 Palinurus was supposed
19 have derived its name 119111 the pilot 91 Aeneas, who was buried there: in 1119
Odyssey‚ Menelaua' pilot dies at his post in the middle 91 his voyage: Ulyssas loscs
911991 his comedes just aa he is about to visit 1119 ahades. 'Virgil has fitted these
fragmenta 19191119 tesselated work, and has thus. as lleyne remarks, secured an
epiaodc 19 give interest to tho voyage 119111 Sicily to Italy, which would otherwise

It is no impeachment 91 the aptuess and relevancy 91 this Book that it probably ’
did 1191191111 pert 91 Virgil's original conception. Gonrods, whose views about 1119

composition 91 tho heneid have beon mentioued in the Introduction to Book 3, has ·

pointed out, what hed occurred mors 91 lose distinctly·to others, that the words
‘Libyco cursu,’ Book 6. 333, naturally mean that Palinurus was lost during the
voyage 119111 Carthago 19 Italy, which accordingly he supposes to hare formed pert
91 the story as Virgil lirst planned it. There are 911191 points in the scene with
Palinurus in Book 6, which it requires some ingenuity to reconcilo with the narrative
at the end 91 this Bookr tha mention 91 Apollo's prediction (6. 313 1911), 1119 911999
¹ laid ou the stormy condition 91 the 999 (11. 351 1911), and perhaps the 111119 during
which Palinurus represents. himself as kept alive aiter his full (ih). rigam, tha ·
request 91 Anchises that Aeneas would consult tho Sibyl mentioned in Book 6. 115,
would seem rather to have been an injunction given in 1119 than identical with that
which we read 91 11. 7 31 1911. 91 this Book. Laetly, tho supposition that this Book
was an aiterthought, would account at 91199 191 thu doubt which oxistcrl iu ancient
times, whether the two first lines 91 Booktl do not really belong 19 the present Book.
Had Virgil lived to complete his work, ho would doubtloss have observed 111999
discrepancies: as it is, they concam the critical scholar rethor than the general
readcr. Tho introduction 91 Nisus and Euryalus in Book 9, as 11 they had not '
appeared in the narratio'n before, may perhaps show that the present Book was

wmpossd later than Book 9.
