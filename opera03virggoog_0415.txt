AENEID. LIB. V. 341

Hic viridem Aeneas frondenti ex ilice metam
Constituit signum nautis pater, unde reverti · 1³0
Scirent et longos ubi circumflectere cursus.

Tum loca sorte legunt, ipsique in puppibus auro
Ductores longe effulgent ostroque decori ;'

Cetera populea velatur fronde iuventus,

Nucrasque umeros oleo perfusa nitescit. 105
Considunt transtris, intentaque bracchia remis;

Intenti exspectant signum, exultantiaque haurit

Corda pavor pulsans laudumque arrecta cupido.

Inde, ubi clara dedit sonitum tuba, finibus omnes,

Haut mora, prosiluere suis3 ferit aethera clamor , 140
