AENEID. LIB. V.

Sed si nostra Dares haee Troius arma recusat,

quue pio sedet Aeneae, probat auctor Acestes,
Aequemus pugnas. Erycis tibi terga remitto;

Solve metus3 et tu Troianos exue caestus. 410
Haec satus duplicem ex umeris reiecit amictum,

Et magnos membrorum artus, magna ossa lacertosque
Exuit, atque ingens media consistit harena.

'l'um satus Anchisa caestus pater extulit aequos,

Et paribus palmas amborum innexuit armis. set
Constitit in digitos extemplo arrectus uterque,
Bracchioque ad superas interritus extulit auras.
