Tertius Eurytion, tuus, o clarissime, frater, 495

Pandare, qui quondam, iussus confundere foedus,

In medios telum torsisti primus Achivos.

Extremus galeaque ima subsedit Acestes,

Ausus et ipse manu iuvenum temptare laborem.

Tum validis flexos incurvant viribus arcus 500
Pro se quisque viri, et depromunt tela pharetris.
Primaque per caelum nervo stridente sagitta
Hyrtacidae iuvenis volueris diverberat auras;

Et venit, adversique infigitur arbore mali.
