Ambiguae spectare rates miserum inter amorem 6⁵5
Praesentis terrae latisque vocantia regna:

Cum dea se peribus per caelum sustulit alis
Ingentenrque fuga secuit sub nubibus arcum.

Tum vero attonitae monstris actaeque lurore
Conclamant, rapiuntque focis penetralibus ignem ; 060
Pars spoliant aras, frondem ac virgulta facesque
Coniciunt. Furit inmissis Volcanus habenis -

Transtra peret remos et pictas abiete puppes.
