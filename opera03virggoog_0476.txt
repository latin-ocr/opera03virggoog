402 P. VERGILI MARONIS

Tempestas sine more furit, tonitruque tremescunt
Ardua terrarum et campi; ruit aethere toto aaa
Turbidus imber aqua densisque nigerrimus austris3
Implenturque super puppes ; semusta madescunt
Robora; restinctus donec vapor omnis, et omnes,
Quattuor amissis, servatae a peste carinae.

Nunc huc ingentis,.nunc illue pectore curas
Mutabat versans, Siculisne resideret arvis,
Oblitus fatorum, Italasne capesseret oras
