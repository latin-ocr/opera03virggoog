404 P. VERGILI MARONIS

Est tibi Dardanius divinae stirpis Acestes:
Hunc cape consiliis socium et coniunge volentem;
Huic trade, amissis superant qui navibus, et qnos
Pertaesum magni incepti rerumque tuarum est3
Longaevosque senes ac fessas aequore matres, ’115
Et quidquid tecum invalidum metuensque pericli cst,
Delige, et his habeant terris sine moenia fessi ;
Urbem appellabunt permisso nomine Acestam.

Talibus incensus dictis senioris amici,
Tum veroin curas animo diducitur omnis. ⁷20
