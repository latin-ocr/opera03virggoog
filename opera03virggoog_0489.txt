'sewum LIB. V. 415

Nube cava rapui, cuperem cum vertere ab imo elo
Structa meis manibus periurae moenia Troiae. Ἰ
Nune quoque mens eadem perstat mihi; pelle timorem.
Tutus, quos optas, portus accedet Averni.

Unus erit tanturn, amissum quem gurgite quaeres;

Unum pro multis dabitur caput. = ⁸15
Hie ubi laeta deae permulsit pectora dictis,

Iungit equos auro Genitor, spumantiaque addit
