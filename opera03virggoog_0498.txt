the nature of those which we have already enoouutered in earlier parts of the pom.
inthe opening of the bools, while we admira th'e descriptiones the temple of Gentes
and the revinge of the Sibyl, aad confess that virgil has there taken full and many
advantage of a supposed form of the supernatural which in Homer’s time was onlyn
its infancy, we must yet feel tho awkwardness with which the Homeris Elpenoris
introduced first ae Misenus above ground, then as Palinurus below, when a druis
drowned friend would have been sufficient both to delay Aeneas' deseent and to uest
< himen thethrcehold of the chades. So again it ie not clear whether it is to rapitity
and indirectncss of narnatino or to carelessness that we are to imputo tha apparet
inoonsistenoy between the intimatione that these rivers, one of thern nincfold had ιο
ho passed by any one wishing to penetrate into the infernal world, and the charn-
stantial detail wirich would lead us to suppose that Asnms only crossed onaand
that only once. But the inconsistsncy'oi treatment becomes more sertam as we
advance further into the book. The lower world, as was said juet now, is disidelby
virgil into a neutral region, a place of torment, aud a place of happiness. Thetwo
latter prceent no difficulty: the conception of the former ie not se satisfactory. ns
general notion seems to bo that it ie tha receptaele of those who, not haring fulhlhd
their natural time of life, cannot bs pronounced good or bad This ie Addisor'r
view,² and it appears to artisfy the requiremsnts of the passage as well ss any the
ean be suggested: but it does not show the post to heva formed a comisteut οοιιοφ
tion. Indsed, l'irgil hinnali may he said to point out to us an incongruity ln aa
picture ho has altana, when he introduces the class of persons who have sured Ι
death hy unjast sentences. We arc ready st once to ask whether it is not thc bn·
nese ef the tribunal of the other world ta rectify the inequalityof certhly jndgments³
and lest the thought should not occur to us, l'irgil suggests it himself by telling us
that the casce of these nrisjudged suffercrs are rcheard below. The natural οοιι·
clusion would bc that, after this relicering, the-spirits, now truly jndgod, are sent ιο
'l'nrtarus or Elysium: but of thie not a word is said, and we are left to suppose that
they rcnraiu in the dubious lirnbo where we first find them. But tho donatores
ιιιιιοιι, extends further. and we rask whether tho infallible hiinos could not prononnco·
au the rcal clramcter ot' all who hare been prematurely cut off. A further question
ariees as to the nature of prematare alcath Τοιιοιιιιι, as afterwards described, oon-
tains many who laeve ‹lied lesere their time hythe visitation oi heaven. Is it·
intended that the Monrning Ficlds should contain all who hare suffered by human
wengrance? Eriphyle ia thcrc; would l'irgil have ventured ιο introduce clyaem·
rrcstra? Agiria, what ie to he said of the lucrose, who occupy the extreme pert of this
neutral region? lt is ιιοι expressly stated that they died in war: we merely hcar of
thern as ‘hello clari.' ‘The pale spectra ef Adrastus ’ happens to be the spirit of the
only one of the Seven against 'Phr-bes who eurrival the expedition. But ewen if we
suppose that l'irgil'e aenenrl conception is that of elain warriors, ean we say that hs .
is consistant with himself in placing elain warriors in ¹a condition neither of torment
nor ol' happiness? 'l'hcre arc heroes in Elysium: thero are those who sufferat
secunde in hattlc for their country. But rrurong the heroes in the neutral region
there arc found not only the rsesailants ef Troy, hut ite defendere. Wae theirs note
patriotic cauae? or are war to distinguish those who wore merely wounded srorn those
wlro wcre kilhal, rand say that tho former earned Elysium by tlreir subscqusnt
lives? ’

Such aro some of the questione that may bc raised abent the earlier part of this
lleok. But they arc as nothing te the arand difficulty which the poet hes οιιοοοιι ιο
create by· his philosophy ot' transrnignaiou The doctrine is a sublime one, aud wcll
