alapres ier poetry: but it is quita incompatible with the conception that pervadens
the ται oi the description oi the lower world. The uentral region, Tartarus, and
Elysium, all diasolre balare it They exist on the assumption that departed spirits

ethereal spirit contracta irem its imprisonment in clay. According to this doctrine.
Dido and Deiphobus, Salmoneus and the Lapithae, ought to have undergone a pro·
longed purification, with a prospect ol resiguing their identity und beeoming ether
personages in later ages. Some indeed, of whom Anchises isthe type, are apparently·
exempted from this general law, and made ιο inhabit Elysium immediately aiter their
expiaticn: bnt the exemptiou seems to praeced irem a different feeling from tbat
which established the law, and at any rate it leaves· the great majority ol spirits
involved in the migratoryeyele. There is inconsisteney alac in the manner iu which
the picture ol the migration is presented. While Virgil isexponnding hia doctrine
he is clear: when he comes to paint it in its maults he becomes confused. 'l'he spirits
that arc to be Romans are spirits that have inhabited other bodies. Why do we bear
every thing about their futare, nothing about their past? tt may be said that they
hare dranis Lethe and leit the pust behind. 'Phia may hold good oi Silviusand one

'l'hese are inquiries which the l'ytlmgoiean doctrine suggests, and which, il treated in
an independent manner, and not brought inte connexion with beliels with which it
has nothing to do, it might perhaps have answered. Alter this, it is comparatively
nnimportant to notice the difficulty which many eritics liare solt about the two gates

absence ol any reason why Aeneas and the Sibyl should be dismissed by the ivery
gata. This last question is arrswered, though with some hesitation, by Gibbon and
lleyue, who remark that corpereal visitante could not be dismissed by the horn gata.
