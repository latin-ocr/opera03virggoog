AENEID. LIB. VI.

Lugentes campi3 sic illos nomine dicunt.
Hic, quos durus amor crudeli tabe peredit,

ς Sacrati celant calles et murtea circum
Silva tegit ; curae non ipsa in morte relincunt
His Phaedram Procrimque locis, maestamque Eriphylen,
Crudelis nati monstrantem volnera, cernit, 446
Euadnenqne et Pasiphaam his Laodamia
It comes, et iuvenis quondam, nunc femina, Caeneus,
